1
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,510
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

2
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,678
Very good, Lieutenant.

3
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,147
We made it.

4
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,317
I guess I was wrong.

5
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,659
There was no danger at all.

6
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,385
Cordé.

7
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,444
Milady, I'm so sorry.

8
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,689
I've failed you, Senator.

9
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,769
No.

10
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,065
Milady, you're still in danger here.

11
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:07,367
I shouldn't have come back.
This vote is very important.

12
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:11,036
You did your duty.
Cordé did hers. Now, come.

13
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,131
Senator Amidala, please.

14
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:30,441
I don't know how much longer
I can hold offthe vote, my friends.

15
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,560
More and more star systems
arejoining the separatists.

16
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,110
Ifthey do break away-
I will not let this Republic...

17
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,784
that has stood for a thousand years
be split in two.

18
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:44,124
My negotiations will not fail.

19
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:48,751
Ifthey do, you must realize
there aren't enoughJedi to protect the Republic.

20
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,380
We're keepers ofthe peace, not soldiers.

21
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,377
Master Yoda.

22
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,223
Do you think it will really come to war?

23
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:04,972
Hmm, the dark side clouds everything.

24
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:10,055
Impossible to see the future is.

25
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:15,055
The Loyalist Committee
has arrived, Your Honor.

26
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,898
Good.

27
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,904
Send them in.

28
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,487
We will discuss this matter later.

29
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:31,956
SenatorAmidala,
your tragedy on the landing platform—

30
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,080
terrible.

31
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,837
Seeing you alive
brings warm feelings to my heart.

32
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,671
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

33
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:45,387
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

34
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,350
I think that Count Dooku was behind it.

35
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:52,352
He is a political idealist, not a murderer.

36
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:55,556
You know, milady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

37
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:59,017
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

38
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,689
But for certain, Senator,

39
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,658
in grave dangeryou are.

40
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,703
MasterJedi, may I suggest...

41
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,696
the senator be placed...

42
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,908
under the protection ofyour graces.

43
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:17,289
Do you really think that's a wise decision
under these stressful times?

44
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,297
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe—

45
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,209
The situation is that serious?

46
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,299
No, but I do, Senator.

47
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,764
I realize all too well
that additional security...

48
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,096
might be disruptive foryou,

49
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:34,352
but perhaps someone you're familiar with.

50
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:38,266
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.

51
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,646
That's possible.

52
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,534
He'sjust returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

53
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,816
Do it for me, milady. Please?

54
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,327
The thought of losing you...

55
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,121
is unbearable.

56
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:56,035
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

57
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,501
Thank you, Master Windu.

58
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,352
You seem a little on edge.

59
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,473
Not at all.
I haven't felt you this tense...

60
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,808
since we fell into that nest ofgundarks.

61
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,944
You fell into that nightmare, Master,

62
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,862
and I rescued you, remember?

63
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,992
Oh... yes.

64
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:33,487
You're sweating. Relax.
Take a deep breath.

65
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,709
I haven't seen her in ten years, Master.

66
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,104
Obi? Obi!

67
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,522
Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!

68
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,941
- Good to see you again,JarJar.
- Senator Padmé.

69
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,651
Mesa palos here! Lookie, lookie, Senator.

70
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,733
Desa Jedi arriven.

71
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,075
It's a great pleasure to see you again, milady.

72
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,699
It has been far too long,
Master Kenobi.

73
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,169
Ani? My goodness, you've grown.

74
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,380
So have you.
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

75
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,212
Well, f-for a senator, I mean.

76
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,719
Ani, you'll always be
that little boy I knew on Tatooine.

77
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,734
Our presence here will be invisible, milady,
I can assure you.

78
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,269
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

79
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,483
Queen Jamillia has been informed
ofyour assignment.

80
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,694
I am grateful you are here, Master Kenobi.

81
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,574
The situation is more dangerous
than the senatorwill admit.

82
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,362
I don't need more security.
I need answers.

83
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,697
I want to know who's trying to kill me.

84
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,622
We are here to protect you, Senator,
not to start an investigation.

85
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,083
We will find out who's trying
to kill you, Padmé.

86
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,325
I promise you.
We will not exceed our mandate,

87
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,337
my young Padawan learner.

88
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,959
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master.

89
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,547
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin,

90
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,514
and you will pay attention to my lead.
Why?

91
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,844
What?

92
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,430
Why else do you think we were assigned to her
if not to find the killer?

93
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,807
Protection is a job
for local security, notJedi.

94
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,766
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.

95
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:29,147
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

96
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,663
And you will learn your place, young one.

97
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,159
Perhaps with merelyyour presence...

98
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,206
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

99
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,091
Now, ifyou'll excuse me,

100
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,169
I will retire.

101
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,466
I know I'll feel better having you here.

102
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:55,549
I'll have an officer stationed on every floor,
and I'll be in the control center downstairs.

103
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,472
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.

104
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,728
She hardly even recognized me,JarJar.

105
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,265
I've thought about her
every day since we parted, and...

106
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,609
she's forgotten me completely.

107
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:15,855
Shesa happy.
Happier den mesa seein her in a longo time.

108
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,989
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful ofyour thoughts.

109
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,538
She was pleased to see us.

110
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,672
Now, let's check the security.

111
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,720
I hit the ship, but they used a decoy.

112
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,392
We'll have to try
something more subtle this time, Zam.

113
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,221
My client is getting impatient.
Take these.

114
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,177
Be careful. They're very poisonous.

115
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,398
Zam, there can be no mistakes this time.

116
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:54,033
Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs.
No assassin would try that way.

117
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,661
Any activity up here?
Quiet as a tomb.

118
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,660
I don't likejust waiting here
for something to happen to her.

119
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,745
What's going on?

120
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,290
Ah, she covered the cameras.

121
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,424
I don't think
she liked me watching her.

122
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,421
What is she thinking?

123
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,553
She programmed R2
to warn us ifthere is an intruder.

124
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,261
There are many otherways to kill a senator.

125
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,762
I know, but we also want to catch
this assassin, don't we, Master?

126
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,931
You're using her as bait.

127
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,138
It was her idea.

128
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,768
Don't worry. No harm will come to her.

129
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,856
I can sense everything going on in that room.

130
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,242
Trust me.

131
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,610
It's too risky.

132
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,237
Besides, your senses aren't that attuned,
myyoung apprentice.

133
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,406
And yours are?

134
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,458
Possibly.

135
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,386
You look tired.

136
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,484
I don't sleep well anymore.

137
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,139
Because ofyour mother?

138
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,114
I don't know why I keep dreaming about her.

139
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,783
Dreams pass in time.

140
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,874
I'd much rather dream about Padmé.

141
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:30,174
Just being around her again is... intoxicating.

142
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,960
Be mindful ofyour thoughts, Anakin.
They betrayyou.

143
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:37,384
You've made a commitment to theJedi order,
a commitment not easily broken.

144
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,215
And don't forget, she's a politician,
and they're not to be trusted.

145
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,931
She's not like the others in the senate, Master.

146
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,972
It is my experience that senators...

147
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:48,806
focus only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns,

148
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:52,443
and they're in no means scared offorgetting
the niceties ofdemocracy...

149
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,774
in order to get those funds.
Not another lecture.

150
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,688
At least not on the economics of politics.

151
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,291
And besides, you're generalizing.

152
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,959
The chancellor doesn't appear
to be corrupt.
Palpatine is a politician.

153
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,718
I have observed that he is very clever...

154
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,800
in following the passions
and the prejudices ofthe senators.

155
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,808
I think he's a good man. My-

156
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,810
I sense it too.

157
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,743
Stay here!

158
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,332
Are you all right, milady?

159
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,297
Ah!

160
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,486
- What the-

161
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,344
Jedi poo doo!

162
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,396
What tookyou so long?
Oh, you know, Master.

163
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,395
I couldn't find
a speeder that I really liked,
There he is.

164
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,907
with the open cockpit
and the right speed capabilities.

165
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,240
Ifyou spent as much time practicing
your saber techniques as you do your wit,

166
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,327
you would rival Master Yoda
as a swordsman.

167
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:40,294
I thought I already did.
Only in your mind,
my veryyoung apprentice.

168
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,236
Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!

169
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,294
You know I don't like it
when you do that.
Sorry, Master.

170
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,794
I forgot you don't like flying.

171
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,746
I don't mind flying,
but what you're doing is suicide.

172
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:59,041
Anakin! How many times have I told you— Ah!—

173
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,332
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
stay away from power couplings!

174
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,327
That was good!

175
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,432
Where are you going? He went that way.

176
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,518
Master, ifwe keep this chase
going any longer,

177
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,654
that creep is gonna end up deep-fried,

178
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:31,031
and, personally, I'd very much like to find out
who he is and who he's working for.

179
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,860
This is a shortcut. I think.

180
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,889
Well, you've lost him.

181
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,056
I'm deeply sorry, Master.

182
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,055
That was some shortcut, Anakin.

183
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,567
He went completely the other way.

184
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,781
Once again you've proved—
Ifyou'll excuse me.

185
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,029
I hate it when he does that.

186
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,639
Anakin!

187
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,636
She went into the club, Master.
Patience.

188
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,647
Use the Force. Think.

189
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,651
Sorry, Master.
He went in there to hide, not to run.

190
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,824
Yes, Master.
Next time, try not to lose it.

191
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:02,704
Yes, Master.
This weapon is your life.

192
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,070
I try, Master.

193
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,077
Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?

194
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,870
Don't say that, Master.
You're the closest thing I have to a father.

195
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,127
Then why don't you listen to me?
I am trying.

196
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:31,596
Can you see him?
I think he is a she,

197
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,444
and I think she is a changeling.

198
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,649
In that case, be extra careful.

199
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,110
Go and find her.
Where are you going, Master?

200
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,744
For a drink.

201
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,958
Thankyou.

202
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,962
You wanna buy some death sticks?

203
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,924
You don't want to sell me death sticks.

204
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,666
I don't want to
sell you death sticks.
You want to go home...

205
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,719
and rethinkyour life.
I want to go home
and rethink my life.

206
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,732
Easy.Jedi business. Go back to your drinks.

207
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:07,359
Do you know who it was
you were trying to kill?

208
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,196
It was a senator from Naboo.

209
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,202
And who hired you?

210
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,244
It wasjust a job.

211
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,578
Who hired you? Tell us.

212
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,080
Tell us now!

213
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:24,922
It was a bounty hunter called—

214
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:32,643
Wee shahnit... sleemo.

215
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,231
Toxic dart.

216
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:58,541
Track down
this bounty hunteryou must, Obi-Wan.

217
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:02,082
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.

218
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,087
What about Senator Amidala?

219
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,089
She will still need protecting.

220
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,131
Handle that your Padawan will.

221
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:14,513
Anakin, escort the senator back
to her home planet of Naboo.

222
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:18,347
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.

223
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,444
Travel as refugees.

224
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,439
As the leader ofthe opposition,
it will be very difficult...

225
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,942
to get Senator Amidala to leave the capital.

226
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,735
Until caught this killer is,

227
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:32,529
ourjudgment she must respect.

228
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,445
Hmm.
Anakin, go to the senate...

229
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,794
and ask Chancellor Palpatine
to speak with her about this matter.

230
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:52,800
I will talk with her. Senator Amidala
will not refuse an executive order.

231
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,085
I know herwell enough to assure you ofthat.

232
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,259
Thankyou, Your Excellency.

233
00:25:57,348 --> 00:26:00,768
And so, they've finally given you an assignment.

234
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,852
Your patience has paid off.

235
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:07,318
Your guidance more than my patience.

236
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,819
You don't need guidance, Anakin.

237
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,161
In time, you will learn to trust your feelings.

238
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,163
Then you will be invincible.

239
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:26,075
I have said it many times:
You are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met.

240
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,088
Thankyou, Your Excellency.

241
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,880
I see you becoming
the greatest ofall theJedi, Anakin,

242
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:34,506
even more powerful than MasterYoda.

243
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,722
I am concerned for my Padawan.

244
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:44,559
He is not ready to be
given this assignment on his own yet.

245
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:47,895
The council is confident
in its decision, Obi-Wan.

246
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:49,942
The boy has exceptional skills.

247
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,485
But he still has much to learn, Master.

248
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:56,069
His abilities have made him,
well, arrogant.

249
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,116
Yes, yes.

250
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,160
A flaw more and more common amongJedi.

251
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:03,155
Hmm.

252
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:05,667
Too sure ofthemselves they are.

253
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:09,209
Even the older, more experienced ones.

254
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,884
Remember, Obi-Wan, ifthe prophecy is true,

255
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:16,675
your apprentice is the only one
who can bring the Force back into balance.

256
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:23,603
I'm taking an extended leave ofabsence.

257
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:26,774
It will be your responsibility
to take my place in the senate.

258
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,805
Representative Binks,
I know I can count on you.
Hmm?

259
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:34,688
Mesa honored to be taking on
dissa heavy burden.

260
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:39,068
Mesa accept this
with muy, muy humility and, uh—

261
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,738
JarJar, I don't wish to hold you up.

262
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,827
I'm sure you have a great deal to do.

263
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,912
Ofcourse. Milady.

264
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,091
I do not like this idea of hiding.

265
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,263
Don't worry.

266
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,591
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation,

267
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,387
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.

268
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:04,392
I haven't worked for a year
to defeat the Military Creation Act...

269
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,725
to not be here when its fate is decided.

270
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:11,400
Sometimes we must let go ofour pride
and do what is requested of us.

271
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:13,942
Anakin, you've grown up.

272
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:18,068
Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it.

273
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,670
Don't get me wrong. Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

274
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,340
As wise as Master Yoda and...

275
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,549
as powerful as Master Windu.

276
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,342
I am truly thankful to be his apprentice.

277
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,560
In some ways— a lot ofways—

278
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,558
I'm really ahead of him.

279
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:52,145
I'm ready for the trials,

280
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,691
but he feels that I'm too unpredictable.

281
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,645
He won't let me move on.

282
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,817
That must be frustrating.
It's worse.

283
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,735
He's overly critical. He never listens.

284
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:05,195
He— He doesn't understand.

285
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,405
It's not fair!

286
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:12,376
All mentors have a way ofseeing
more ofour faults than we would like.

287
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,499
It's the only way we grow.

288
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,629
I know.

289
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,014
Anakin.

290
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,845
Don't try to grow up too fast.

291
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,891
But I am grown up.

292
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,060
You said it yourself.

293
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:35,307
Please don't look at me like that.

294
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:40,025
- Why not?
- It makes me feel uncomfortable.

295
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,989
Sorry, milady.

296
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,224
Be safe, milady.
Thankyou, Captain.

297
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,181
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.

298
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,262
He'll be safe with me.

299
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:15,232
- You'll be fine.
- It's not me, milady.

300
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:19,074
I worry about you.
What ifthey realize you've left the capital?

301
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:23,531
Well, then myJedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.

302
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:25,534
Anakin.

303
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:28,736
Don't do anything without first consulting
either myselfor the council.

304
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,827
Yes, Master.

305
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:34,504
I'll get to the bottom
ofthis plot quickly, milady.

306
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,503
You'll be back here in no time.

307
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,835
I'll be most grateful
foryour speed, MasterJedi.

308
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,842
It's time to go.
I know.

309
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:44,514
Anakin, may the Force be with you.

310
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,643
May the Force be with you, Master.

311
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,016
Suddenly I'm afraid.

312
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,738
This is my first assignment
on my own. I am too.

313
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,701
Don't worry. We have R2 with us.

314
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:16,787
I do hope he doesn't try anything foolish.

315
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,375
I'd be more concerned
about her doing something than him.

316
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,277
Someone to see ya, honey!

317
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,279
Jedi, by the looks of him.

318
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:51,282
- Obi-Wan!
- Hello, Dex.

319
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:53,998
Take a seat. I'll be right with ya.

320
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:59,383
- You wanna cup o'jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thankyou.

321
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:06,418
Hey, old buddy!

322
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,470
Ohhh.

323
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,939
So, my friend, what can I do forya?

324
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,861
You can tell me what this is.

325
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,230
Well, whattaya know!

326
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:27,699
I ain't seen one ofthese
since I was prospectin'...

327
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,029
on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.

328
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,616
Can you tell me where it came from? Thankyou.

329
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:36,662
This baby belongs to them cloners.

330
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:41,077
What you got here is a Kamino saberdart.

331
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:44,168
I wonderwhy it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

332
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:47,594
It's these funny little cuts on the side
that give it away.

333
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:51,644
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols. Huh!

334
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,970
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect...

335
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:56,306
for the difference
between knowledge and...

336
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,231
wisdom.

337
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:02,731
Well, ifdroids could think,
there'd be none of us here, would there?

338
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,482
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

339
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,528
No, no. It's beyond the outer rim.

340
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:12,242
I'd say about, uh, 1 2 parsecs...

341
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,244
outside the Rishi Maze.

342
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,286
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

343
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:24,631
These, uh, Kaminoans keep to themselves.

344
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,591
They're cloners. Damn good ones too.

345
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:32,177
Cloners. Are they friendly?
Oh, depends.

346
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,180
Depends on what, Dex?

347
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,182
On how good your manners are...

348
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,515
and how big your, uh,

349
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:42,601
pocketbook is.

350
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,976
Hmm.

351
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,451
Did you call for assistance?

352
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:57,243
Yes, yes, I did.
Are you having a problem,
Master Kenobi?

353
00:33:57,327 --> 00:34:00,617
Yes, um, I'm looking
for a planetary system called Kamino.

354
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,037
Kamino.
It doesn't show up
on the archive charts.

355
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:07,415
Kamino.
It's not a system I'm familiar with.

356
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,884
Are you sure you have the right coordinates?

357
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:13,005
According to my information,
it should appear in this quadrant here,

358
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,183
just south ofthe Rishi Maze.

359
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:25,442
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...

360
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,442
doesn't exist.

361
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:30,824
Impossible.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

362
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,992
Ifan item does not appear in our records,

363
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,202
it does not exist.

364
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,429
Hey, you! No droids!

365
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:03,807
Get outta here!

366
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,234
Thankyou, R2.

367
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:14,898
Must be difficult,
having sworn your life to theJedi,

368
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:18,908
not being able to visit the places you like
or do the things you like.

369
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,122
Or be with the people that I love.

370
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:23,873
Are you allowed to love?

371
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,035
I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.

372
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,884
Attachment is forbidden.

373
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,593
Possession is forbidden.

374
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:39,255
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love,

375
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,846
is central to a Jedi's life.

376
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:48,597
So you might say
that we are encouraged to love.

377
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:53,360
You've changed so much.
Ah, you haven't changed a bit.

378
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:56,323
You're exactly the way
I rememberyou in my dreams.

379
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:12,709
Reach out.
Sense the Force around you.

380
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,546
Use your feelings you must.

381
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,928
Younglings. Younglings!

382
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,474
A visitorwe have.

383
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:28,479
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

384
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:31,652
Hello. I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.

385
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:35,441
What help can I be, Obi-Wan? Hmm?

386
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,447
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

387
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,700
I trust him, but the systems don't show
on the archive maps.

388
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:46,083
Mmm. Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.

389
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,124
How embarrassing.

390
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,866
How embarrassing.

391
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,669
Hmm? Liam, the shades.

392
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:57,505
Gather round the map reader.

393
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:59,761
Clearyour minds...

394
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:03,353
and find Obi-Wan's wayward planet we will.

395
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:07,734
It ought to be... here,

396
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,729
but it isn't.

397
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:13,231
Gravity is pulling all the stars in the area
towards this spot.

398
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:16,935
Hmm. Gravity's silhouette remains,

399
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:20,027
but the star and all the planets,

400
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:22,113
disappeared they have.

401
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,238
How can this be?

402
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:26,536
Hmm? A thought?

403
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,869
Anyone.
Master?

404
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,878
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.

405
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:42,343
Truly wonderful the mind ofa child is.

406
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,223
The Padawan is right.

407
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:50,387
Go to the center ofgravity's pull...

408
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:54,017
and find your planet you will.

409
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:02,704
Hmm. The data must have been erased.

410
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,571
But, MasterYoda,
who could empty information from the archives?

411
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:07,579
That's impossible, isn't it?

412
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:11,081
Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is.

413
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:15,544
Only a Jedi could have erased those files.

414
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:19,087
But who and why, harder to answer.

415
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:23,723
Meditate on this I will. Hmm.

416
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,156
I wasn't the youngest queen ever elected,

417
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:53,865
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

418
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,957
I'm not sure I was ready.

419
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:59,252
The people you served
thought you did a good job.

420
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:03,007
I heard they even tried to amend the constitution
so you could stay in office.

421
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,801
I was relieved when my two terms were up.

422
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:09,595
But when the queen
asked me to serve as senator,

423
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,891
I couldn't refuse her.

424
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:15,345
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.

425
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,609
I'm glad that you chose to serve.

426
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,494
If the senate votes to create an army,

427
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:32,116
I'm sure it's going
to push us into a civil war.
It's unthinkable.

428
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,623
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation ofthe Republic.

429
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,207
Do you see any way through negotiations...

430
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,423
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

431
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,713
Not ifthey feel threatened.

432
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:46,217
My guess is they'll turn to the Trade Federations
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

433
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:50,681
It's outrageous,
but after four trials in the Supreme Court,

434
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:54,564
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
ofthe Trade Federation.

435
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,692
I fear the senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.

436
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,975
We must keep our faith in the Republic.

437
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:13,910
The day we stop believing
democracy can work is the day we lose it.

438
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,745
Let's pray that day never comes.

439
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,501
In the meantime,
we must consideryour own safety.

440
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,594
What is your suggestion, MasterJedi?

441
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,590
Oh, Anakin's not a Jedi yet.

442
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,762
He's still a Padawan learner.
But I was thinking—

443
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,431
Hold on a minute.
Excuse me.

444
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,931
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.

445
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:34,263
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.

446
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,429
Excuse me.
I'm in charge ofsecurity here, milady.

447
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:41,189
And this is my home.
I know it very well. That is why we're here.

448
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:45,822
I think it would be wise ifyou took advantage
of my knowledge in this instance.

449
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,071
Sorry, milady.

450
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,405
Perfect. It's settled, then.

451
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:13,053
There it is, R4, right where it should be.
Our missing planet Kamino.

452
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,087
MasterJedi.

453
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,598
The prime minister is expecting you.

454
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,225
I'm expected?
Ofcourse.

455
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,347
He is anxious to meet you.

456
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,648
After all these years,

457
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:09,362
we were beginning to thinkyou weren't coming.

458
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,704
Now, please, this way.

459
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,959
May I present Lama Su,

460
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,125
prime minister of Kamino.

461
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,050
And this is MasterJedi—

462
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,054
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

463
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:38,466
I trust you're going to enjoyyour stay.

464
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,891
Please.

465
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,729
And now to business.

466
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:49,823
You will be delighted
to hear that we are on schedule.

467
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,780
200,000 units are ready,

468
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:55,282
with a million more well on the way.

469
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:58,326
That's good news.

470
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,579
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas...

471
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:05,043
that his order will be met on time.

472
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,134
I'm sorry. Master—

473
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:12,090
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas
is still a leading member oftheJedi Council,

474
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,093
is he not?

475
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:18,005
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

476
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:21,966
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

477
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:26,348
But I'm sure he would have
been proud ofthe army we've built for him.

478
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,108
- The army?
- Yes.

479
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:34,901
A clone army, and I must say,
one ofthe finest we've ever created.

480
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:36,988
Tell me, Prime Minister,

481
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:39,623
when my master first
contacted you about the army,

482
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:41,831
did— did he say who it was for?

483
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:43,951
Ofcourse he did.

484
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,748
This army is for the Republic.

485
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:51,213
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units foryourself.

486
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,875
That's why I'm here.

487
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:17,815
We used to come here for school retreat.

488
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,704
We would swim to that island every day.

489
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:24,952
I love the water.

490
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,707
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us...

491
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,546
and try to guess
the names ofthe birds singing.

492
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,345
I don't like sand.

493
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:46,430
It's coarse and rough and irritating,

494
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,517
and it gets everywhere.

495
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,318
Not like here.

496
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,399
Here, everything is soft...

497
00:44:57,487 --> 00:44:59,697
and smooth.

498
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,525
No.

499
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:40,651
I shouldn't have done that.

500
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,365
I'm sorry.

501
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:01,844
Very impressive.
I'd hoped you would be pleased.

502
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:07,471
Clones can think creatively.

503
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:11,517
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.

504
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:20,651
We take great pride in our combat education
and training programs.

505
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:24,106
This group was created about five years ago.

506
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,278
You mentioned growth acceleration.

507
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:28,327
Oh, yes, it's essential.

508
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:31,451
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.

509
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:34,169
Now we can do it in halfthe time.

510
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,960
I see.

511
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,964
They are totally obedient,

512
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,756
taking any orderwithout question.

513
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:43,931
We modified their genetic structure...

514
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,220
to make them less independent
than the original host.

515
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,885
And who was the original host?

516
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:52,104
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.

517
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,814
And where is this bounty hunter now?

518
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:58,057
Oh, we keep him here.

519
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:03,533
Apart from his pay, which is considerable,

520
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:06,163
Fett demanded only one thing:

521
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,780
an unaltered clone for himself.

522
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,370
Curious, isn't it?
"Unaltered"?

523
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:14,004
Pure genetic replication.

524
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,291
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile...

525
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,916
and no growth acceleration.

526
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:23,344
I should very much
like to meet thisJango Fett.

527
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:26,684
I would be very happy to arrange it foryou.

528
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:47,107
Magnificent, aren't they?

529
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:56,162
I don't know.

530
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:58,419
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.

531
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,881
You gonna use one ofyour
Jedi mind tricks on me?

532
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:03,132
They only work on the weak-minded.

533
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:07,722
All right. I was 1 2.

534
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:11,052
His name was Palo. We were both
in the Legislative Youth Program.

535
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,218
He was a fewyears older than I.
Very cute.

536
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,688
Dark, curly hair. Dreamy eyes.

537
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:19,059
All right, I get the picture.

538
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,056
Whatever happened to him?

539
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,068
I went into public service;
he went on to become an artist.

540
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:28,413
Maybe he was the smart one.
You really don't like politicians, do you?

541
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,699
I like two or three,

542
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,873
but I'm not really sure about one ofthem.

543
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,171
I don't think the system works.

544
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,170
How would you have it work?

545
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:46,763
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem,

546
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:50,891
agree what's in the best interest
ofall the people, and then do it.

547
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,930
That's exactly what we do.

548
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:55,024
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.

549
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,979
Well, then they should be made to.

550
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:00,981
By whom?
Who's gonna make them? You?
I don't know. Someone.

551
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,435
Ofcourse not me.
But someone.

552
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:05,444
Someone wise.

553
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:09,356
Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.

554
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:13,115
Well, if it works.

555
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:22,002
You're making fun of me.
No.

556
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,714
I'd be much too frightened to tease a senator.

557
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:48,192
Whoa, whoa!

558
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:52,908
Oh, whoa!

559
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:07,339
Ani! Ani, are you all right?

560
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,630
Boba, is your father here?

561
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,669
Yep.

562
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,843
May we see him?

563
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:52,802
Sure.

564
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:56,513
Dad, Taun We's here.

565
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,400
Jango, welcome back.

566
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,396
Was your trip productive?

567
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,448
Fairly.

568
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:20,412
This isJedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

569
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:23,544
He's come to check on our progress.

570
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:26,502
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

571
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:29,634
I'm just a simple man
trying to make my way in the universe.

572
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:33,422
Ever made yourway
as far into the interior as Coruscant?

573
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,467
- Once or twice.
- Recently?

574
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,220
Possibly.

575
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:42,516
Then you must know Master Sifo-Dyas.

576
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,112
Uh, Boba, roodehtso-heeck.

577
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:53,646
Master who?

578
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,776
Sifo-Dyas.

579
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:58,533
Is he not theJedi
who hired you for thisjob?

580
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,372
Never heard of him.

581
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:08,415
Really?

582
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:12,551
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one ofthe moons of Bogden.

583
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,880
Curious.

584
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:21,179
Do you like your army?

585
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,263
I look forward to seeing them in action.

586
00:52:24,517 --> 00:52:27,887
They'll do theirjob well. I'll guarantee that.

587
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,188
Thankyou foryour time,Jango.

588
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,069
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

589
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,670
What is it, Dad?

590
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,087
Packyour things. We're leaving.

591
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:08,314
And when I got to them, we went into
aggressive negotiations. Thankyou.

592
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,484
"Aggressive negotiations"? What's that?

593
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:13,613
Uh, well, negotiations with a lightsaber.

594
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,322
Oh.

595
00:53:26,996 --> 00:53:30,156
If Master Obi-Wan caught me doing this,
he'd be very grumpy.

596
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,736
From the moment I met you...

597
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:05,373
all those years ago,

598
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:08,491
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought ofyou.

599
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:14,125
And now that I'm with you again,

600
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,339
I'm in agony.

601
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:23,585
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.

602
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,137
The thought of not being with you—

603
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,351
I can't breathe.

604
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:38,148
I'm haunted by the kiss
that you should never have given me.

605
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,573
My heart is beating,

606
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:43,663
hoping that that kiss will not become a scar.

607
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:48,703
You are in my very soul,

608
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,866
tormenting me.

609
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:56,882
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.

610
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:11,393
Ifyou are suffering as much as I am,
please, tell me.

611
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,187
I can't.

612
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:19,323
We can't. It's...just not possible.

613
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,400
Anything is possible, Padmé. Listen to me.

614
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:25,106
No, you listen.

615
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:28,827
We live in a real world. Come back to it.

616
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:32,579
You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm— I'm a senator.

617
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:36,955
Ifyou followyour thoughts
through to conclusion,

618
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,592
it'll take us to a place we cannot go,

619
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:43,046
regardless ofthe way we feel about each other.

620
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:45,172
Then you do feel something.

621
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:48,339
I will not let you
give up your future for me.

622
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:50,599
You are asking me to be rational.

623
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:53,984
That is something I know I cannot do.

624
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:58,979
Believe me, I wish that I could just
wish away my feelings,

625
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:01,694
but I can't.

626
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,565
I will not give in to this.

627
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,868
Well, you know, it...

628
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,794
wouldn't have to be that way.

629
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:19,794
We could keep it a secret.

630
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,210
We'd be living a lie,

631
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:25,627
one we couldn't keep even ifwe wanted to.

632
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:28,965
I couldn't do that.

633
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,972
Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?

634
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:36,981
No. You're right.

635
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,395
It would destroy us.

636
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:52,073
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

637
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:55,289
And remind them, ifthey need more troops,

638
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:58,500
it will take more time to grow them.

639
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:02,344
I won't forget, and thankyou.
Thank you.

640
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:20,435
- R4!

641
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:24,191
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care ofthe old folks' home!

642
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:34,079
I have successfully made contact
with the prime minister of Kamino.

643
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:38,079
They are using a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett to create a clone army.

644
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,673
I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter...

645
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:42,879
is the assassin we are looking for.

646
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,130
Do you think these cloners are involved
in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala?

647
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:50,134
No, Master.
There appears to be no motive.

648
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:53,137
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.

649
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,260
Clearyour mind must be...

650
00:57:56,348 --> 00:58:00,518
ifyou are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.

651
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,522
Yes, Master.

652
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:05,654
They say Master Sifo-Dyas
placed an order for a clone army...

653
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:09,402
at the request ofthe senate
almost ten years ago.

654
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:15,073
I was under the impression
he was killed before that.

655
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:18,698
Did the council ever authorize
the creation ofa clone army?

656
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:23,077
No. Whoever placed that order
did not have the authorization oftheJedi Council.

657
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,836
Bring him here. Question him we will.

658
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:31,090
Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.

659
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:36,549
Blind we are ifcreation ofthis clone army...

660
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,558
we could not see.

661
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:44,192
I think it is time we informed the senate...

662
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,271
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.

663
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:51,525
Only the dark lord ofthe Sith
knows ofour weakness.

664
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:53,862
If informed the senate is,

665
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,447
multiply our adversaries will.

666
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:00,445
No.

667
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,037
No.
Anakin! Help me!

668
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:04,333
Mom, no.

669
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:07,038
Anakin!
Don't.

670
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:14,553
No.

671
00:59:33,654 --> 00:59:35,994
Don't go.

672
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,991
I don't want to disturb you.

673
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,286
Your presence is soothing.

674
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:48,246
You had another nightmare last night.

675
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:52,249
Jedi don't have nightmares.

676
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:54,379
I heard you.

677
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,354
I saw my mother.

678
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,387
She is suffering, Padmé.

679
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:12,065
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.

680
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:24,544
She is in pain.

681
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:30,383
I know I'm disobeying
my mandate to protect you, Senator,

682
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,550
but I have to go.

683
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:37,474
I have to help her.

684
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,097
I'll go with you.

685
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,509
I'm sorry. I don't have a choice.

686
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:56,776
Dad, look!

687
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:59,532
Boba, get on board!

688
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,484
- Oh, not good.

689
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:29,615
- Wait right there.
- Okey-okey.

690
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,240
Da wanga!

691
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:34,658
Chut-chut, Watto.

692
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:38,959
Let me help you with that.

693
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:43,381
What? What do you want?

694
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:45,973
Wait! You're a Jedi!

695
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,263
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

696
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:52,474
Ai!

697
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:57,138
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

698
01:04:58,687 --> 01:05:00,977
Ani?

699
01:05:03,275 --> 01:05:05,275
Little Ani?

700
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:10,324
Nahhh.

701
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:15,948
You are Ani! It is you!

702
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:20,077
You sure sprouted, huh? Wee-hoo!

703
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:23,916
AJedi! Whattaya know!

704
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:29,844
Hey... maybe you could help
with some deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

705
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,426
My mother.

706
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:34,391
Oh, yeah. Shmi.

707
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:38,732
Uh... she's not mine-a no more-a. I sold her.

708
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:41,150
You sold her?
Years ago.

709
01:05:41,229 --> 01:05:45,399
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business, huh?

710
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:49,283
Yeah, I sold her to a moisture farmer
named, uh, Lars.

711
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:51,362
At least I think it was Lars.

712
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:54,988
Believe it or not,
I heard he freed her and married her!

713
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:58,536
Can ya beat that, eh?
Yeah.

714
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,960
Do you know where they are now?

715
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:04,962
Ooh, long way from here.

716
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:09,545
Someplace over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think, mmm.

717
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:11,722
I'd like to know.

718
01:06:13,345 --> 01:06:16,095
Eh, sure. Absolutely!

719
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:19,141
Let's go look at my records, huh?

720
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,765
Mmm.

721
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:48,674
Dad!

722
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:50,665
I think we're being tracked!

723
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:54,217
He must have put a homing device on our hull.

724
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:56,602
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field,

725
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:59,179
and we'll have a couple ofsurprises for him.

726
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:13,987
Seismic charges! Stand by.

727
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:41,974
He doesn't seem to take a hint, this guy.

728
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:01,830
Watch out!

729
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:24,345
Get him, Dad! Get him! Fire!

730
01:08:26,186 --> 01:08:28,806
Oh, blast! This is why I hate flying!

731
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:52,501
- We got him!
- We'll just have to finish him.

732
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:23,203
- R4, prepare tojettison the spare part canisters.

733
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:28,752
- Fire them now!

734
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:43,386
Well, we won't be seeing him again.

735
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:21,934
- Well, R4, I think we've waited long enough.

736
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:44,410
There's an unusual concentration
of Federation ships over there, R4.

737
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,940
Stay with the ship, R2.

738
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:38,207
Oh! Um, uh, hello.

739
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:41,004
How might I be ofservice? I am C—

740
01:11:41,089 --> 01:11:44,759
3PO?
Oh, um—

741
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,762
The maker!

742
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:50,104
Oh, Master Ani! I knewyou would return.

743
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:52,931
I knew it! And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.

744
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:54,937
Hello, 3PO.

745
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:58,939
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.

746
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:01,023
I've come to see my mother.

747
01:12:01,109 --> 01:12:04,899
Oh. Um, I think perhaps we'd better go indoors.

748
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:12,372
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.

749
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:14,793
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

750
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:18,958
Owen Lars.
Uh, this is my girlfriend, Beru.

751
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:22,173
- Hello.
- I'm Padmé.

752
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:24,835
I guess I'm your stepbrother.

753
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:27,844
I had a feeling you might show up someday.

754
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:32,221
Is my mother here?
No, she's not.

755
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:36,266
Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife.

756
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:41,404
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.

757
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:52,078
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.

758
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:55,950
A hunting party ofTusken Raiders.

759
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:58,958
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did,

760
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:03,041
to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporators.

761
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:06,719
From the tracks, she was about halfway home...

762
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:08,759
when they took her.

763
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:12,263
Those Tuskens walk like men,

764
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:17,136
but they're vicious, mindless monsters.

765
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:21,976
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.

766
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:27,074
I'd be out there with them,
but after I lost my leg,

767
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:32,823
I just couldn't ride anymore un-until I heal.

768
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:35,659
I don't want to give up on her,

769
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:38,615
but she's been gone a month.

770
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:41,786
There's little hope she's lasted this long.

771
01:13:46,506 --> 01:13:48,916
Where are you going?

772
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:51,048
To find my mother.

773
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:55,140
Your mother's dead, son. Accept it.

774
01:14:17,245 --> 01:14:20,285
You're gonna have to stay here.

775
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:23,583
These are good people, Padmé.
You'll be safe.

776
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:26,338
Anakin—

777
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:37,678
I won't be long.

778
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,632
We must persuade the Commerce Guild...

779
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:31,129
and the Corporate Alliance to sign the treaty.

780
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:34,712
What about the senator from Naboo?

781
01:16:34,799 --> 01:16:37,299
Is she dead yet?

782
01:16:37,385 --> 01:16:41,345
I am not signing your treaty until I have
her head on my desk.

783
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,770
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

784
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:46,939
With these new battle droids
we've built foryou,

785
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:50,229
you'll have the finest army in the galaxy.

786
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:03,027
As I explained to you earlier,

787
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:06,369
I am quite convinced
that 1 0,000 more systems...

788
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:09,325
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.

789
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:13,172
What you are proposing
could be construed as treason.

790
01:17:13,254 --> 01:17:15,634
The Techno Union army...

791
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:21,851
is at your disposal, Count.

792
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:26,219
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.

793
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,228
Good. Very good.

794
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:33,020
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support,

795
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:35,727
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours,

796
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:39,648
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.

797
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:43,409
TheJedi will be overwhelmed.

798
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:47,332
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.

799
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:48,058
Mom.

800
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,180
Mom? Mom?

801
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,561
Ani?

802
01:18:55,815 --> 01:18:59,605
Ani? Is it you?

803
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:04,488
I'm here, Mom. You're safe.

804
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:10,453
Ani?

805
01:19:10,538 --> 01:19:13,538
Oh, you look so handsome.

806
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:19,051
My son.

807
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:21,970
Oh, my grown-up son.

808
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:25,717
I'm so proud ofyou, Ani.

809
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:27,763
I missed you.

810
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,636
Now I am complete.

811
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:41,687
I love y-

812
01:19:42,862 --> 01:19:45,992
Stay with me, Mom. Everything—

813
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:48,203
I love—

814
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:52,202
I— I love—

815
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:53,595
Anakin! Anakin! No-o-o!

816
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,331
What is it?

817
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:20,383
Pain, suffering,

818
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:22,459
death I feel.

819
01:21:26,966 --> 01:21:30,126
Something terrible has happened.

820
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:37,725
Young Skywalker is in pain.
Terrible pain.

821
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:46,234
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.

822
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:49,028
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?

823
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:52,164
We'll have to try something else.

824
01:21:55,536 --> 01:21:59,996
Maybe we can contact Anakin on Naboo.
It's much closer.

825
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:04,536
Anakin? Anakin, do you copy?

826
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:07,588
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?

827
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:09,633
He's not on Naboo, R4.

828
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:13,802
I'm going to try and widen the range.

829
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:19,182
I do hope nothing's happened to him.

830
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:28,528
That's Anakin's tracking signal, all right,

831
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:31,110
but it's coming from Tatooine.

832
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:35,278
What in the blazes is he doing there?

833
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:37,287
I told him to stay on Naboo.

834
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:42,577
We haven't got much time.

835
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,666
Anakin? Anakin, do you copy?

836
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:46,883
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

837
01:22:54,762 --> 01:22:58,682
Retransmit this message—

838
01:22:58,766 --> 01:23:01,426
Anakin, do you copy? Anakin—

839
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:03,898
My long-range—
has been knocked out.

840
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:08,231
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.

841
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:52,901
I brought you something.

842
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:55,146
Are you hungry?

843
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,865
The shifter broke.

844
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:03,582
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.

845
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:09,498
I'm good at fixing things. Always was.

846
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:13,797
But I couldn't—

847
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:19,723
Why'd she have to die?

848
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:25,313
Why couldn't I save her?

849
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:27,484
I know I could have!

850
01:24:30,149 --> 01:24:32,859
Sometimes there are things
no one can fix.

851
01:24:34,361 --> 01:24:36,991
You're not all-powerful, Ani.
Well, I should be!

852
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:42,200
Someday I will be.

853
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:44,906
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever!

854
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:49,292
I promise you.

855
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:51,786
I will even learn to stop people from dying.

856
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:53,956
Anakin.

857
01:24:55,382 --> 01:24:58,222
It's all Obi-Wan's fault!

858
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:01,302
He'sjealous! He's holding me back!

859
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:08,141
What's wrong, Ani?

860
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,570
I—

861
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:20,867
I killed them.

862
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:24,539
I killed them all.

863
01:25:26,205 --> 01:25:28,325
They're dead.

864
01:25:28,415 --> 01:25:30,495
Every single one ofthem.

865
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:34,591
And notjust the men,

866
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,631
but the women...

867
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:40,587
and the children too.

868
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:46,057
They're like animals,
and I slaughtered them like animals!

869
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:49,734
I hate them!

870
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:09,499
To be angry is to be human.

871
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:11,541
I'm a Jedi.

872
01:26:12,543 --> 01:26:14,543
I know I'm better than this.

873
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:33,190
I know wherever you are
it's become a better place.

874
01:26:33,272 --> 01:26:38,282
You were the most loving partner
a man could ever have.

875
01:26:41,071 --> 01:26:43,281
Good-bye, my darling wife.

876
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,250
And thankyou.

877
01:27:16,273 --> 01:27:18,823
I wasn't strong enough to save you, Mom.

878
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,153
I wasn't strong enough.

879
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:31,116
But I promise I won't fail again.

880
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:44,125
I miss you...

881
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:47,389
so much.

882
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:57,021
R2? What are you doing here?

883
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:04,150
It seems that he is carrying a message
from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

884
01:28:04,237 --> 01:28:07,617
Hmm. MasterAni,
does that name mean anything to you?

885
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:12,905
Anakin, my long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.

886
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:15,246
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.

887
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:21,958
I have tracked the bounty hunter,
Jango Fett,

888
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:24,217
to the droid foundries on Geonosis.

889
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:27,799
The Trade Federation is to take delivery
ofa droid army here,

890
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:30,096
and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray...

891
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:33,680
is behind the assassination attempts
on Senator Amidala.

892
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:35,977
The Commerce Guilds
and the Corporate Alliance...

893
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:39,731
have both pledged their armies
to Count Dooku and are forming a—

894
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:41,895
Wait. Wait.

895
01:28:52,703 --> 01:28:57,373
More happening on Geonosis,
I feel, than has been revealed.

896
01:28:57,457 --> 01:28:59,537
I agree.

897
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:02,916
Anakin, we will deal with Count Dooku.

898
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:06,594
The most important thing foryou
is to stay where you are.

899
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:09,425
Protect the senator at all costs.

900
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:12,101
That is your first priority.

901
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:15,558
Understood, Master.

902
01:29:15,642 --> 01:29:17,692
They'll never get there in time to save him.

903
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:20,899
They have to come
halfway across the galaxy. Look.

904
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:25,154
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

905
01:29:25,235 --> 01:29:27,275
If he's still alive.

906
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:31,744
Ani, are you just
gonna sit here and let him die?

907
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:34,407
He's your friend, your mentor. He's—
He's like my father!

908
01:29:34,494 --> 01:29:39,294
But you heard MasterWindu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here!

909
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:42,674
He gave you strict orders to protect me,

910
01:29:42,753 --> 01:29:46,173
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

911
01:29:46,298 --> 01:29:51,008
If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.

912
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:57,140
I'm not worried, R2.
It'sjust I've never flown before.

913
01:30:07,486 --> 01:30:10,356
The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war.
There can be no doubt ofthat.

914
01:30:10,447 --> 01:30:12,407
Count Dooku
must have made a treaty with them.

915
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:15,911
The debate is over.

916
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:19,004
Now we need that clone army.

917
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:22,080
Unfortunately, the debate is not over.

918
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:26,457
The senate will never approve the use ofclones
before the separatists attack.

919
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:28,456
This is a crisis.

920
01:30:28,548 --> 01:30:31,678
The senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.

921
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,100
He can then approve the creation ofan army.

922
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:40,060
But what senator would have the courage
to propose such a radical amendment?

923
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:44,313
Ifonly... SenatorAmidala were here.

924
01:30:46,024 --> 01:30:48,324
Mm.

925
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:07,917
Traitor.

926
01:31:08,004 --> 01:31:11,344
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

927
01:31:11,424 --> 01:31:13,344
They have gone too far. This is madness.

928
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:16,046
I thought you were the leader here, Dooku.

929
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:18,757
This had nothing to do with me,
I assure you.

930
01:31:18,849 --> 01:31:22,309
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.

931
01:31:22,394 --> 01:31:26,064
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long.
I have work to do.

932
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:29,977
May I ask why a Jedi knight...

933
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:32,528
is all the way out here on Geonosis?

934
01:31:32,612 --> 01:31:35,532
I've been tracking
a bounty hunter named Jango Fett.

935
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:37,525
Do you know him?

936
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:40,197
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.

937
01:31:40,287 --> 01:31:42,287
The Geonosians don't trust them.

938
01:31:42,372 --> 01:31:45,252
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.

939
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:51,133
It's a great pity that our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

940
01:31:51,214 --> 01:31:53,674
Qui-Gon always spoke very highly ofyou.

941
01:31:58,555 --> 01:32:00,595
I wish he were still alive.

942
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:04,768
I could use his help right now.

943
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:07,855
Qui-Gon Jinn would neverjoin you.

944
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:12,821
Don't be so sure, myyoungJedi.

945
01:32:12,903 --> 01:32:15,493
You forget that he was once
my apprentice,

946
01:32:15,572 --> 01:32:17,622
just as you were once his.

947
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:19,829
He knew all about
the corruption in the senate,

948
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:23,870
but he would never have gone along with it
if he had learned the truth as I have.

949
01:32:23,997 --> 01:32:26,497
The truth?
The truth.

950
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:35,093
What if I told you that the Republic...

951
01:32:35,175 --> 01:32:38,335
was now under the control
ofthe dark lord ofthe Sith?

952
01:32:38,428 --> 01:32:41,638
No, that's not possible.
TheJedi would be aware of it.

953
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:47,063
The dark side ofthe Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.

954
01:32:47,145 --> 01:32:49,725
Hundreds ofsenators
are now under the influence...

955
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:54,444
ofa Sith lord called Darth Sidious.

956
01:32:55,278 --> 01:32:57,398
I don't believe you.

957
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:59,569
The viceroy ofthe Trade Federation...

958
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:03,658
was once in league with this Darth Sidious,

959
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:07,615
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.

960
01:33:07,707 --> 01:33:10,827
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.

961
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:14,964
You mustjoin me, Obi-Wan,

962
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:20,142
and together we will destroy the Sith!

963
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:24,180
I will neverjoin you, Dooku.

964
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:36,565
It may be difficult to secure your release.

965
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:47,290
It's-a clear
desa separatists made a pact...

966
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:50,042
wesa desa Federation du Trade.

967
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:54,455
Senators, "dellow felagates":

968
01:33:54,546 --> 01:33:58,586
In response to this direct threat
to the Republic,

969
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:02,385
mesa propose that the senate...

970
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:06,140
give immediately emergency powers...

971
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:08,644
to the supreme chancellor.

972
01:34:11,104 --> 01:34:15,114
Palpatine! Palpatine! Palpatine!

973
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:21,453
Order! We shall have order!

974
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:26,486
It is with great reluctance...

975
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:28,578
that I have agreed to this calling.

976
01:34:29,873 --> 01:34:34,753
I love democracy. I love the Republic.

977
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:37,046
The poweryou give me...

978
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:41,180
I will lay down
when this crisis has abated.

979
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:50,979
And as my first act with this new authority,

980
01:34:51,061 --> 01:34:55,481
I will create a grand army ofthe Republic...

981
01:34:55,565 --> 01:34:59,395
to counter the increasing threats
ofthe separatists.

982
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:02,605
It is done, then.

983
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:05,277
Hmm.

984
01:35:07,869 --> 01:35:11,579
I will take whatJedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

985
01:35:11,664 --> 01:35:16,544
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino, hmm,

986
01:35:16,628 --> 01:35:20,458
and see this army
they have created for the Republic.

987
01:35:41,111 --> 01:35:43,031
See those columns ofsteam straight ahead?

988
01:35:43,113 --> 01:35:45,203
They're exhaust vents ofsome type.

989
01:35:45,281 --> 01:35:48,031
That'll do.

990
01:35:56,334 --> 01:36:00,424
Look, whatever happens out there,
follow my lead.

991
01:36:00,505 --> 01:36:02,915
I'm not interested
in getting into a war here.

992
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:04,927
As a member ofthe senate,

993
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:07,849
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.

994
01:36:07,929 --> 01:36:12,179
Don't worry.
I've given up trying to argue with you.

995
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:20,438
My obtuse little friend,
ifthey had needed our help,

996
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:22,435
they would have asked for it, hmm?

997
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:25,107
You obviously have a great deal to learn
about human behavior.

998
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:52,680
- For a mechanic,

999
01:36:52,765 --> 01:36:54,765
you seem to do an excessive amount ofthinking.

1000
01:36:54,851 --> 01:36:59,441
- I am programmed to understand humans!

1001
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:04,944
"What does that mean?" Oh!

1002
01:37:05,028 --> 01:37:07,738
That means I am in charge here!

1003
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:11,032
Where are you going now?
You don't know what's out there.

1004
01:37:11,117 --> 01:37:14,367
Have you no sense at all? Oh! Idiot!

1005
01:37:17,332 --> 01:37:19,832
Please wait.

1006
01:37:19,918 --> 01:37:21,878
Do you know where you're going?

1007
01:37:34,432 --> 01:37:36,602
Wait.

1008
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:46,488
Oh, my- Oh, oh, oh!

1009
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:59,121
- Padmé!

1010
01:38:22,605 --> 01:38:24,645
Ah!

1011
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:55,296
Oh, my goodness! Shut me down!

1012
01:38:56,347 --> 01:38:58,347
Machines making machines.

1013
01:38:58,433 --> 01:39:01,273
Huh! How perverse.
Oh!

1014
01:39:01,352 --> 01:39:04,902
Calm down, R2. I almost fell.

1015
01:39:04,981 --> 01:39:07,021
You'll get your chance—

1016
01:39:08,818 --> 01:39:11,778
Oh! I'm scrap.

1017
01:39:11,863 --> 01:39:14,913
It's a nightmare!

1018
01:39:16,034 --> 01:39:18,044
Oh, I want to go home! Ahh!

1019
01:39:19,454 --> 01:39:21,464
Oh, what did I do to deserve this?

1020
01:39:43,770 --> 01:39:46,730
Ahhh!

1021
01:39:58,743 --> 01:40:03,623
- Hmm. I wonder what happened to poor little R2.

1022
01:40:03,706 --> 01:40:06,116
He's always getting himself into trouble. Oops.

1023
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:09,090
Oh, no!

1024
01:40:18,471 --> 01:40:20,141
Uh-oh.

1025
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:23,675
Oh!

1026
01:40:23,768 --> 01:40:25,768
Oh, I'm so confused.

1027
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:22,718
Oh, not again.

1028
01:42:23,763 --> 01:42:25,763
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.

1029
01:42:34,774 --> 01:42:37,944
Don't move,Jedi! Take him away.

1030
01:42:57,296 --> 01:42:58,796
Don't be afraid.

1031
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:02,590
I'm not afraid to die.

1032
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:11,560
I've been dying a little bit
each day since you came back into my life.

1033
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:15,400
What are you talking about?

1034
01:43:16,816 --> 01:43:18,936
I love you.

1035
01:43:22,655 --> 01:43:24,655
You love me?

1036
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:32,410
I thought that we had decided
not to fall in love,

1037
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:37,883
that we would be forced to live a lie...

1038
01:43:37,962 --> 01:43:41,012
and that it would destroy our lives.

1039
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:44,180
I think our lives are about
to be destroyed anyway.

1040
01:43:49,307 --> 01:43:52,057
I truly,

1041
01:43:52,143 --> 01:43:54,603
deeply love you,

1042
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:58,360
and before we die, I want you to know.

1043
01:44:05,823 --> 01:44:07,993
Eeyah!

1044
01:44:55,456 --> 01:44:58,116
I was beginning to wonder
ifyou'd got my message.

1045
01:44:58,209 --> 01:45:01,339
I retransmitted it
just as you had requested, Master.

1046
01:45:03,631 --> 01:45:05,551
Then we decided to come and rescue you.

1047
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:08,050
Good job.

1048
01:45:20,189 --> 01:45:23,439
Settle down. Settle down.

1049
01:45:27,405 --> 01:45:31,155
Let the executions begin.

1050
01:46:03,899 --> 01:46:06,859
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1051
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:34,926
-Just relax. Concentrate.
- What about Padmé?

1052
01:46:35,014 --> 01:46:37,184
She seems to be on top ofthings.

1053
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:43,920
She can't do that!
Shoot her or— or something!

1054
01:48:37,094 --> 01:48:41,604
- Whoa! Yah!

1055
01:48:42,766 --> 01:48:45,016
Hyah! Hyah!

1056
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,160
Jump!

1057
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:11,630
Hyah! Hyah!

1058
01:49:28,228 --> 01:49:33,568
This isn't how it's supposed to be!
Jango! Finish her off!

1059
01:49:33,651 --> 01:49:36,901
Patience, Viceroy, patience. She will die.

1060
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:11,650
Master Windu,
how pleasant ofyou tojoin us.

1061
01:50:11,730 --> 01:50:13,820
This party's over.

1062
01:50:27,329 --> 01:50:32,499
Brave but, uh, foolish, my old Jedi friend.

1063
01:50:32,626 --> 01:50:36,496
You're impossibly outnumbered.
I don't think so.

1064
01:50:36,588 --> 01:50:39,258
- We'll see.

1065
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:19,419
My legs aren't moving. I must need maintenance.

1066
01:51:59,129 --> 01:52:01,589
What's all this noise? A-A battle!

1067
01:52:01,673 --> 01:52:03,883
Oh, there's been some terrible mistake!

1068
01:52:03,967 --> 01:52:06,757
I'm programmed for etiquette, not destruction!

1069
01:53:34,224 --> 01:53:38,024
Die,Jedi dogs! Oh! What did I say?

1070
01:53:42,107 --> 01:53:43,357
Hah!

1071
01:53:47,029 --> 01:53:50,409
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1072
01:53:51,491 --> 01:53:53,531
Ohh!

1073
01:53:55,996 --> 01:53:58,956
Excuse me. I'm trapped. I can't get up.

1074
01:54:12,888 --> 01:54:14,558
You call this a diplomatic solution?

1075
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:16,930
No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

1076
01:54:22,022 --> 01:54:24,022
Uh-oh.
Roger, roger.

1077
01:54:41,166 --> 01:54:44,456
R2, what are you doing here?

1078
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:50,261
What are you doing? Oh, stop that!

1079
01:54:50,342 --> 01:54:52,682
You're going to strain something. My neck!

1080
01:54:55,055 --> 01:54:58,975
Now where are you taking me?
Oh, this is such a drag.

1081
01:55:03,188 --> 01:55:06,018
Oh, I'm quite beside myself.

1082
01:55:14,700 --> 01:55:17,790
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!

1083
01:55:17,869 --> 01:55:21,959
- Yes, but is my head on straight?

1084
01:55:44,730 --> 01:55:48,650
Master Windu, you have fought gallantly,

1085
01:55:48,734 --> 01:55:53,864
worthy of recognition
in the archives oftheJedi order.

1086
01:55:56,116 --> 01:55:59,156
Now it is finished.

1087
01:56:00,579 --> 01:56:05,419
Surrender, and your lives will be spared.

1088
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:09,380
We will not be hostages to be bartered, Dooku!

1089
01:56:09,463 --> 01:56:14,093
Then, I'm sorry, old friend.

1090
01:56:25,645 --> 01:56:27,055
Look!

1091
01:56:37,324 --> 01:56:42,204
Around the survivors a perimeter create.

1092
01:57:37,676 --> 01:57:41,756
Oh, I've had the most peculiar dream.

1093
01:57:52,315 --> 01:57:54,315
If Dooku escapes,

1094
01:57:54,401 --> 01:57:57,821
rally more systems to his cause he will.

1095
01:58:02,659 --> 01:58:04,449
Hold on!

1096
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:11,040
Aim right above the fuel cells!

1097
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:20,380
Good call, myyoung Padawan.

1098
01:58:33,690 --> 01:58:36,190
The Jedi have amassed a huge army.

1099
01:58:36,276 --> 01:58:38,646
That doesn't seem possible.

1100
01:58:38,737 --> 01:58:41,357
How could the Jedi
come up with an army so quickly?

1101
01:58:41,448 --> 01:58:44,738
We must send
all available droids into battle.

1102
01:58:44,826 --> 01:58:46,736
There are too many.

1103
01:58:46,828 --> 01:58:50,498
Our communications have been jammed.

1104
01:58:57,797 --> 01:59:03,047
- Pilot, land in that assembly area!
- Yes, sir.

1105
01:59:11,061 --> 01:59:14,861
Sir, I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.

1106
01:59:16,066 --> 01:59:19,396
To the forward command center take me.

1107
01:59:42,676 --> 01:59:45,466
Attack those Federation starships! Quickly!

1108
01:59:56,398 --> 02:00:00,228
MasterYoda,
all forward positions are advancing.

1109
02:00:00,318 --> 02:00:03,948
Very good. Very good.

1110
02:00:32,809 --> 02:00:35,939
This is not looking good at all!

1111
02:00:36,021 --> 02:00:39,321
We must get the starships
back into space.

1112
02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:46,279
We have to order a retreat.

1113
02:00:46,364 --> 02:00:48,784
My master will never allow the Republic...

1114
02:00:48,867 --> 02:00:51,237
to get away with this treachery.

1115
02:00:51,328 --> 02:00:54,538
I'm sending my warriors
to hide in the catacombs.

1116
02:00:54,623 --> 02:00:58,583
TheJedi must not find
our designs for the ultimate weapon.

1117
02:01:01,212 --> 02:01:06,472
Ifthey find out what we are planning to build,
we're doomed.

1118
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:12,099
I will take the designs with me to Coruscant.

1119
02:01:12,182 --> 02:01:15,812
They will be much safer there
with my master.

1120
02:02:10,281 --> 02:02:15,081
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.

1121
02:02:15,161 --> 02:02:17,041
Yes, sir.

1122
02:02:17,122 --> 02:02:20,622
Move all quadrants to sector 5-1 -5.

1123
02:03:00,707 --> 02:03:02,247
Look over there!

1124
02:03:05,670 --> 02:03:08,090
It's Dooku! Shoot him down!

1125
02:03:08,173 --> 02:03:10,093
We're out of rockets, sir.

1126
02:03:10,175 --> 02:03:13,255
Follow him!
We're gonna need some help!

1127
02:03:13,344 --> 02:03:17,264
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!

1128
02:03:40,663 --> 02:03:43,293
- Put the ship down!
- Anakin!

1129
02:03:43,374 --> 02:03:47,174
Don't let your personal feelings get in the way!
Follow that speeder!

1130
02:03:53,218 --> 02:03:55,588
Lower the ship!
I can't take Dooku alone!

1131
02:03:55,678 --> 02:03:59,138
I need you! Ifwe catch him,
we can end this war right now!

1132
02:03:59,265 --> 02:04:02,305
We have a job to do!
I don't care! Put the ship down!

1133
02:04:02,393 --> 02:04:04,653
You will be expelled from theJedi order!

1134
02:04:04,771 --> 02:04:08,021
I can't leave her!
Come to your senses!

1135
02:04:08,107 --> 02:04:10,817
What do you think Padmé would do
were she in your position?

1136
02:04:15,406 --> 02:04:17,486
She would do her duty.

1137
02:04:21,037 --> 02:04:23,117
Hmm.

1138
02:04:26,417 --> 02:04:28,497
The droid army is in full retreat.

1139
02:04:28,586 --> 02:04:31,706
Well done, Commander. Bring me a ship.

1140
02:04:58,700 --> 02:05:01,790
You're gonna pay
for all the Jedi that you killed today, Dooku.

1141
02:05:01,911 --> 02:05:04,711
We'll take him together.
Go in slowly on the left.
I'm taking him now!

1142
02:05:04,789 --> 02:05:07,169
No, Anakin! No! No!

1143
02:05:13,882 --> 02:05:17,382
As you see,
myJedi powers are far beyond yours.

1144
02:05:17,468 --> 02:05:20,468
Now... back down.

1145
02:05:24,350 --> 02:05:26,600
I don't think so.

1146
02:05:39,407 --> 02:05:42,617
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.

1147
02:05:42,702 --> 02:05:45,832
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.

1148
02:05:49,417 --> 02:05:51,747
Surelyyou can do better.

1149
02:06:01,804 --> 02:06:03,724
Are you all right?

1150
02:06:03,806 --> 02:06:06,216
Uh-huh.

1151
02:06:06,351 --> 02:06:10,061
We'd better get back to
the forward command center.
No. No.

1152
02:06:10,146 --> 02:06:13,686
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.

1153
02:06:13,816 --> 02:06:16,986
Get a transport. Hurry!
Right away.

1154
02:06:29,457 --> 02:06:32,877
Ah! Ahh!

1155
02:06:42,053 --> 02:06:43,973
Brave of you, boy.

1156
02:06:45,181 --> 02:06:47,431
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.

1157
02:06:47,517 --> 02:06:49,807
- I am a slow learner.
- Anakin!

1158
02:07:51,581 --> 02:07:56,541
- MasterYoda.
- Count Dooku.

1159
02:07:56,627 --> 02:08:00,007
You have interfered
with our affairs for the last time.

1160
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:34,660
Powerful you have become, Dooku.

1161
02:08:34,749 --> 02:08:37,829
The dark side I sense in you.

1162
02:08:37,919 --> 02:08:40,799
I've become more powerful than anyJedi.

1163
02:08:42,006 --> 02:08:43,506
Even you.

1164
02:08:58,648 --> 02:09:01,938
Much to learn you still have.

1165
02:09:02,026 --> 02:09:07,066
It is obvious that this contest cannot be decided
by our knowledge ofthe Force...

1166
02:09:09,659 --> 02:09:12,289
but by our skills with a lightsaber.

1167
02:09:53,161 --> 02:09:57,251
Fought well you have, my old Padawan.

1168
02:09:57,331 --> 02:09:59,171
This isjust the beginning.

1169
02:11:14,033 --> 02:11:15,533
Anakin!

1170
02:12:32,153 --> 02:12:34,903
The Force is with us, Master Sidious.

1171
02:12:34,989 --> 02:12:37,869
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.

1172
02:12:39,577 --> 02:12:42,287
You have done well.

1173
02:12:42,371 --> 02:12:44,411
I have good news foryou, my lord.

1174
02:12:46,083 --> 02:12:49,463
The war has begun.
Excellent.

1175
02:12:49,545 --> 02:12:52,255
Everything is going as planned.

1176
02:13:02,308 --> 02:13:04,388
Do you believe what Count Dooku said...

1177
02:13:04,477 --> 02:13:06,727
about Sidious controlling the senate?

1178
02:13:06,812 --> 02:13:09,112
It doesn't feel right.

1179
02:13:09,190 --> 02:13:12,150
Joined the dark side Dooku has.

1180
02:13:12,234 --> 02:13:15,204
Mmm. Lies, deceit,

1181
02:13:15,279 --> 02:13:19,319
creating mistrust are his ways now.

1182
02:13:19,408 --> 02:13:23,788
Nevertheless, I feel we should keep
a closer eye on the senate.

1183
02:13:23,871 --> 02:13:25,911
I agree.

1184
02:13:26,999 --> 02:13:28,919
Where is your apprentice?

1185
02:13:29,001 --> 02:13:32,921
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.

1186
02:13:34,673 --> 02:13:38,343
I have to admit that without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.

1187
02:13:38,427 --> 02:13:40,507
Victory?

1188
02:13:40,596 --> 02:13:43,766
Victory, you say?

1189
02:13:43,849 --> 02:13:47,599
Master Obi-Wan, not victory.

1190
02:13:49,105 --> 02:13:52,395
The shroud ofthe dark side has fallen.

1191
02:13:53,818 --> 02:13:57,528
Begun the Clone War has.

1192
02:22:25,829 --> 02:22:26,829
English - US - Placed SDH
