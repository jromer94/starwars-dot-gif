1
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,943
- Lock onto him, R2.

2
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,482
- Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead-

3
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,818
the one crawling with vulture droids.

4
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,453
Oh, I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.

5
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,670
Oddball, do you copy?
Copy, Red Leader.

6
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,039
Mark my position. Form your squad up behind me.

7
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,037
We're on your tail, General Kenobi.

8
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,089
Set S-foils in attack position.

9
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,018
This is where the fun begins.

10
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,145
Let them pass between us.

11
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:12,794
- They're all over me. Get them off my—

12
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,839
I'm gonna go help them out.
No.

13
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,671
No, they are doing theirjob so we can do ours.

14
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,185
Missiles. Pull up.

15
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,189
- They overshot us.
- They're coming around.

16
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,372
- All right, R4.

17
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,042
No, no, no, no- No, nothing too fancy.

18
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,999
Surge all power units, R2.
Stand by reverse thrusters.

19
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,393
- We got 'em, R2.

20
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,730
Flying is for droids.

21
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,737
- I'm hit. Anakin?
- I see them. Buzz droids.

22
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,375
R4, be careful. You have a-

23
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,431
- Oh, dear.

24
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,393
They're shutting down all the controls.

25
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,521
- Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.
- The mission.

26
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:53,479
Get to the command ship. Get the chancellor.
I'm running out oftricks here.

27
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:00,646
- Oh! In the name of-

28
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:06,946
- Hold your fire! You're not helping here.
- I agree. Bad idea.

29
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,131
I can't see a thing. My cockpit's fogging.

30
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,299
They're all over me. Anakin!

31
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:28,011
- Move to the right.
- Hold on, Anakin. You're gonna get us both killed.

32
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,475
Get out of here.
There's nothing more you can do.

33
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,769
I'm not leaving without you, Master.

34
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,567
- Get him, R2.

35
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:50,026
- Watch out.

36
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,963
R2, hit the buzz droid's center eye.

37
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,514
- Yeah, you got him!
- Great, R2.

38
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,724
The general's command ship is dead ahead.

39
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,888
Well, have you noticed the shields are still up?

40
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,016
Sorry, Master.

41
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,648
Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.

42
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,631
There they are. Get them.

43
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:57,144
- R2, locate the chancellor.

44
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,237
The chancellor's signal
is coming from right there—

45
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,411
the observation platform
at the top ofthat spire.

46
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,411
I sense Count Dooku.

47
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,825
I sense a trap.
Next move?

48
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,503
- Spring the trap.

49
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,794
R2, go back.
I need you to stay with the ship.

50
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,799
Here. Take this and wait for orders.

51
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:43,613
What's the situation, Captain?

52
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,650
TwoJedi have landed in the main hangar bay.
We're tracking them.

53
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:52,026
Just as Count Dooku predicted.

54
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,292
Destroyers.

55
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,302
Drop your weapons. I said drop 'em.

56
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,923
Roger.
Roger, roger.

57
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,218
Roger, roger.

58
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,770
Those areJedi fighters all right.

59
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,398
Did you press the stop button?
No. Did you?

60
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,784
- No.
- Well, there's more than one way out of here.

61
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,702
We don't want to get out.

62
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:38,491
We want to get moving.
R2, activate elevator 31 1 74.

63
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,788
Come in, R2.
What that?

64
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,792
R2, do you copy?

65
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,794
R2, activate the elevator number...

66
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,126
31 1 74.

67
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,172
Get back to work. That nothin'.

68
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,216
Activate the elevator 31 1 74.

69
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,221
R2, we-

70
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,940
Always on the move.

71
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,939
R2, switch on the comlink.

72
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,061
R2, can you hear me?

73
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,608
- R2?

74
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:10,993
Whoa!

75
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,199
R2! R2!

76
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:20,038
Stop. Stop. R2, we need to be going up.

77
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,365
Hands up,Jedi.

78
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,667
R2, do you copy?

79
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,751
R2, do you hear me?
R2, we need to be going up, not down.

80
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,603
- Hey, you!

81
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,676
Now, that's better.

82
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:48,058
- You stupid little astro droid.

83
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,282
- Uh-oh.

84
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,121
Oh, it's you.

85
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,077
My eyes! My eyes!

86
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,615
What was that all about?
Well, R2 has been-

87
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,670
Uh, no loose wirejokes.
Did I say anything?

88
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,754
He's trying.
I didn't say anything.

89
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,285
Chancellor.
Are you all right?

90
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,997
Count Dooku.

91
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:01,472
This time we will do it together.
I was about to say that.

92
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,606
Get help. You're no match for him.
He's a Sith lord.

93
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,781
Chancellor Palpatine,
Sith lords are our speciality.

94
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,782
Your swords, please.

95
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,365
We don't want to make a mess ofthings
in front ofthe chancellor.

96
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,702
You won't get away this time, Dooku.

97
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,632
I've been looking forward to this.

98
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,927
My powers have doubled
since the last time we met, Count.

99
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,522
Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.

100
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,578
Get-

101
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:37,902
I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.

102
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,654
You have hate. You have anger.

103
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,698
But you don't use them.

104
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:07,101
Good, Anakin. Good.

105
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,220
Kill him.

106
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,273
Kill him now.

107
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,819
I shouldn't.

108
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:23,784
Do it.

109
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,712
You did well, Anakin.

110
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,755
He was too dangerous to be kept alive.

111
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,260
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.

112
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,223
I shouldn't have done that.
It's not theJedi way.

113
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:53,484
It is only natural.
He cut offyour arm, and you wanted revenge.

114
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,599
It wasn't the first time, Anakin.

115
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:00,478
Remember what you told me
about your mother and the Sand People?

116
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,856
Now we must leave
before more security droids arrive.

117
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,254
Anakin, there's no time.

118
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,580
We must get offthis ship before it's too late.

119
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:21,707
- He seems to be all right.
- Leave him, orwe'll never make it.

120
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,506
His fate will be the same as ours.

121
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,138
Prepare for attack!

122
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,350
All batteries, fire! Fire!

123
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,321
Elevator's not working.

124
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,704
R2, activate elevator 3224.

125
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,638
- Reverse stabilizers.
- Reversing stabilizers.

126
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,081
Magnetize! Magnetize!

127
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,958
Fire the emergency booster engines.

128
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,889
We're leveling out, sir.

129
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,476
Oh!

130
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,782
Easy. We're in a bit ofa situation here.

131
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,526
Did I miss something?
Hold on.

132
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,827
- What is that?
- Uh, oops.

133
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,911
R2. R2, shut down the elevator.

134
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,956
Too late.Jump!

135
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,184
Let's see ifwe can find something
in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

136
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,387
R2, get down here.

137
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,766
R2, do you copy?

138
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,401
General, we found theJedi.

139
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:53,987
They're in hallway 328.
Activate ray shields.

140
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,235
Ray shields.

141
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,197
Wait a minute. How did this happen?

142
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,709
We're smarter than this.
Apparently not.

143
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,877
I say patience.
Patience?

144
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:11,262
Yes. R2 will be along in a few moments,

145
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,630
and then... he'll release the ray shields.

146
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,475
See? No problem.

147
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,733
Don't move.

148
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,685
Ow!

149
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,646
Do you have a plan "B"?

150
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:43,907
Ah, yes. The negotiator.

151
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:48,248
General Kenobi. We've been waiting foryou.

152
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,496
Excuse me.

153
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:53,378
That wasn't much ofa rescue.
You're welcome.

154
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,926
And-

155
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,800
Anakin Skywalker.

156
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:04,638
I was expecting someone
with your reputation to be a little... older.

157
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:11,019
General Grievous.
You're shorter than I expected.

158
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:15,648
Jedi scum.

159
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,528
We have a job to do, Anakin.
Try not to upset him.

160
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:27,999
Your lightsabers will make a fine addition
to my collection.

161
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,804
Not this time.
And this time, you won't escape.

162
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,129
R2.

163
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,595
- Crush them!

164
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,760
Make them suffer!

165
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,479
Come. Now!

166
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,773
Stay at your stations!
Whoa!

167
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,945
Get him! Get him!

168
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,286
Ow!

169
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,179
Run!

170
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,273
Don't bother with them.
Keep the ship in orbit.
Yes, sir.

171
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,989
You lose, General Kenobi.

172
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,885
Get out of here! Run!

173
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,529
Time to abandon ship.

174
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,167
All the escape pods
have been launched.

175
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,289
Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?

176
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,459
You mean, do I know how to land
what's left ofthis thing?
Well?

177
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:42,127
Well, under the circumstances,
I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

178
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,428
Strap yourselves in.

179
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,059
Open all hatches.
Extend all flaps and drag fins.

180
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:06,945
- We lost something.

181
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,544
Not to worry. We are still flying halfa ship.

182
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,790
- Now we're really picking up speed.

183
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,178
Eight plus 60.

184
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:31,394
We're in the atmosphere.
Grab that. Keep us level.

185
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,660
- Steady.

186
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,412
Easy, R2.

187
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:57,291
5000. Fire ships on the left and the right.

188
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,126
We'll take you in.
Copy that.

189
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:06,296
- Landing strip, straight ahead.
- We're coming in too hot.

190
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,382
Another happy landing.

191
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:13,583
- Are you coming, Master?
- Oh, no. I'm not brave enough for politics.

192
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,581
I have to report to the council.

193
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,123
Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.

194
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:22,087
Hold on.
This whole operation was your idea.

195
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:25,299
Let us not forget, Anakin,
that you rescued me from the buzz droids.

196
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,841
And you killed Count Dooku,
and you rescued the chancellor,

197
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,835
carrying me unconscious on your back.

198
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,467
All because ofyour training.

199
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:36,095
Anakin, let's be fair. Today you were the hero,

200
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,273
and you deserve your glorious day
with the politicians.

201
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:43,443
All right. But you owe me one,
and not for saving your skin for the 1 0th time.

202
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:47,784
Ninth time. That business on Cato Neimoidia
doesn't- doesn't count.

203
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:49,782
I'll see you at the briefing.

204
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,659
Chancellor Palpatine, are you all right?

205
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,666
Yes. Thanks to your twoJedi knights.

206
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:05,459
They killed Count Dooku,
but General Grievous has escaped once again.

207
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:09,086
General Grievous will run and hide,
as he always does. He's a coward.

208
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:13,514
But with Count Dooku dead,
he is the leader ofthe droid army.

209
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:19,346
And I assure you, the senate will vote
to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.

210
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:23,515
Then theJedi Council
will make finding Grievous our highest priority.

211
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,860
Watch it.
Excuse me.

212
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,994
Come along, R2.
The Republic cannot praise you enough.

213
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,160
Thankyou, Senator Organa.

214
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:35,831
Well, it couldn't possibly
be as bad as all that.

215
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,911
Now there I agree with you.

216
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:41,365
- In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.

217
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:46,627
But the fighting will continue
until General Grievous is spare parts.

218
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,172
Well, I will do everything I can in the senate.

219
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,588
Excuse me.
Certainly.

220
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,146
Oh, Anakin.

221
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,897
- I've missed you, Padmé.

222
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:13,319
There were whispers that you'd been killed.

223
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,985
I'm all right.

224
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:19,075
It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime.

225
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:22,001
And it might have been,
ifthe chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.

226
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,331
I don't think they would have
ever brought us back from the outer rim sieges.

227
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:28,209
Wait. Not here.
Yes, here.

228
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,795
I'm- I'm tired ofall this deception.
I don't care ifthey know we're married.

229
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:34,182
Anakin, don't say things like that.

230
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:46,597
Are you all right? You're trembling.

231
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,859
What's going on?

232
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,151
Something wonderful has happened.

233
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:58,365
Ani, I'm pregnant.

234
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,249
That's—

235
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,958
Well, that's won- That's wonderful.

236
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,724
What are we gonna do?

237
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,598
We're not gonna worry about anything
right now. All right?

238
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,182
This is a happy moment.

239
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,475
The happiest moment of my life.

240
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:37,466
Yes, Lord Sidious?

241
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,469
General Grievous,

242
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:44,681
I suggest you move
the separatist leaders to Mustafar.

243
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:48,635
It will be done, my lord.

244
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:53,017
The end ofthe war is near, General.

245
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:56,727
But the loss ofCount Dooku-

246
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:01,159
His death was a necessary loss.

247
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,410
Soon I will have a new apprentice-

248
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:10,794
one faryounger and more powerful.

249
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,816
Ani, I want to have our baby
back home on Naboo.

250
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,284
We can go to the lake country
where no one will know,

251
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,276
where we can be safe.

252
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,834
I can go early and fix up the baby's room.

253
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:58,133
I know the perfect spot. Right by the gardens.

254
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:05,724
You are so... beautiful.

255
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,346
It's only because I'm so in love.

256
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,893
No.

257
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:15,147
No, it's because I'm so in love with you.

258
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:18,862
So love has blinded you?

259
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,701
Well, that's not exactly what I meant.

260
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,319
But it's probably true.

261
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:37,464
Anakin, help me!

262
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,609
What's bothering you?

263
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:47,027
Nothing.

264
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,277
I remember when I gave this to you.

265
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:55,618
How long is it gonna take
for us to be honest with each other?

266
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,076
It was a dream.

267
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,338
Bad?

268
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,881
Like the ones I used to have
about my mother,

269
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,875
just before she died.

270
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,877
And?

271
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,682
And it was about you.

272
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,186
Tell me.

273
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,856
It was only a dream.

274
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,746
You die in childbirth.

275
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,620
And the baby?

276
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,078
I don't know.

277
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,455
It was only a dream.

278
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,377
I won't let this one become real.

279
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,138
This baby will change our lives.

280
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,140
I doubt the queen will continue to allow me
to serve in the senate.

281
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,983
And ifthe council discovers
you're the father, you'll be expelled-

282
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,600
I- I know. I know.

283
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:04,397
Do you think Obi-Wan
might be able to help us?

284
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,441
We don't need his help.

285
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,778
Our baby is a blessing.

286
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:33,135
Premonitions? Premonitions. Hmm.

287
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,390
These visions you have-

288
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:40,103
They're of pain, suffering.

289
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,940
Death.

290
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:48,442
Yourselfyou speak of, or someone you know?

291
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,953
Someone.

292
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,950
Close to you?

293
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:57,367
Yes.

294
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:01,332
Careful you must be
when sensing the future, Anakin.

295
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:05,745
The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.

296
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:11,263
I won't let these visions
come true, MasterYoda.

297
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:14,551
Death is a natural part of life.

298
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:19,346
Rejoice for those around you
who transform into the Force.

299
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:22,733
Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not.

300
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,941
Attachment leads tojealousy.

301
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:29,482
The shadow ofgreed that is.

302
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,398
What must I do, Master Yoda?

303
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,567
Train yourselfto let go...

304
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:39,117
ofeverything you fear to lose.

305
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,264
You've missed the report
on the outer rim sieges.

306
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:56,045
I'm sorry. I was held up.

307
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:59,758
I have no excuse.
In short, they are going very well.

308
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:05,268
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

309
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,403
What's wrong, then?

310
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,112
The senate is expected...

311
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:13,692
to vote more executive powers
to the chancellor today.

312
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:18,158
Well, that can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?

313
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,701
It'll make it easier for us to end this war.

314
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,752
Be careful ofyour friend Palpatine.

315
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,254
Be careful ofwhat?

316
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,996
He has requested your presence.
What for?

317
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:35,759
He would not say.
He didn't inform the council?

318
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:39,354
That's unusual, isn't it?
All ofthis is unusual.

319
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,889
And it's making me feel uneasy.

320
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,783
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

321
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,025
Ofcourse.

322
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,080
I need your help, son.

323
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,205
What do you mean?

324
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:12,552
I'm depending on you.
Forwhat? I don't understand.

325
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:18,219
To be the eyes, ears
and voice ofthe Republic.

326
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,471
Anakin,

327
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:24,724
I'm appointing you to be my personal
representative on theJedi Council.

328
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:28,098
Me? A master?

329
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,608
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

330
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:36,613
But the council elects its own members.
They'll never accept this.

331
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:40,195
I think they will. They need you.

332
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:42,742
More than you know.

333
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:58,220
Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.

334
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,760
Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.

335
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,509
I understand.

336
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:09,688
You are on this council,
but we do not grant you the rank of master.

337
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,809
What?

338
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:20,280
How can you do this? This is outrageous.

339
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,533
It's unfair.

340
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,158
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?

341
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,785
Take a seat, young Skywalker.

342
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,125
Forgive me, Master.

343
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:42,134
We have surveyed all systems in the Republic,

344
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,968
but have found no sign ofGeneral Grievous.

345
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,846
Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.

346
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,063
The outlying systems you must sweep.

347
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,395
We do not have many ships to spare.

348
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,691
What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?

349
00:37:56,775 --> 00:38:00,485
It is critical we send
an attack group there immediately.

350
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:04,030
He's right. It's a system
we cannot afford to lose.

351
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,445
Go I will.

352
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,575
Good relations with the Wookiees I have.

353
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:15,004
It's settled then.
Yoda will take a battalion ofclones...

354
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:17,415
to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

355
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,594
May the Force be with us all.

356
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,470
What kind of nonsense is this?

357
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,972
Put me on the council
and not make me a master?

358
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,805
It's never been done
in the history oftheJedi. It's insulting.

359
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,811
Oh, calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honor.

360
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:36,944
To be on the council at your age-
it's never happened before.

361
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:40,443
The fact ofthe matter is
you are too close to the chancellor.

362
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:44,277
The council doesn't like it
when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

363
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:50,156
I swear to you, I didn't ask
to be put on the council.
But it's what you wanted.

364
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:53,575
Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine
seems to have paid off.

365
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,575
That has nothing to do with this.

366
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,627
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

367
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:01,672
is because the chancellor trusts you.

368
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,798
And?
Anakin, I am on your side.

369
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:08,256
I didn't want to put you
in this situation.
What situation?

370
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:16,688
The council wants you to report
on all the chancellor's dealings.

371
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,151
They want to know what he's up to.

372
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:26,493
They want me to spy on the chancellor?

373
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,284
But that's treason.
We are at war, Anakin.

374
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,246
Why didn't the council give me this assignment
when we were in session?

375
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,790
This assignment is not to be on record.

376
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:40,835
The chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.

377
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,960
He befriended me. He's watched out for me
ever since I arrived here.

378
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,178
That is whyyou must help us.

379
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:49,759
Anakin, our allegiance is to the senate,
not to its leader,

380
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:53,556
who has managed to stay in office
long after his term has expired.

381
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,641
The senate demanded that he stay longer.

382
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,897
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.

383
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:03,570
You're asking me
to do something against theJedi code,

384
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:07,401
against the Republic,
against a mentor and a friend.

385
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:11,329
That's what's out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?

386
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,540
The council is asking you.

387
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:27,262
Anakin did not take to his new assignment
with much enthusiasm.

388
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,552
It's very dangerous, putting them together.

389
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,967
I don't think the boy can handle it.

390
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,596
I don't trust him.

391
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:39,563
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?

392
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:43,356
Is he not to destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force?

393
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,321
So the prophecy says.

394
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:51,322
A prophecy that misread could have been.

395
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,037
He will not let me down.

396
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,079
He never has.

397
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,213
I hope right you are.

398
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:28,903
Sometimes I wonder
what's happening to theJedi order.

399
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:32,067
I think this war is destroying
the principles ofthe Republic.

400
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:37,118
Have you ever considered
that we may be on the wrong side?

401
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,713
What do you mean?

402
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:44,419
What ifthe democracy we thought
we were serving no longer exists,

403
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:48,132
and the Republic has become
the very evil we've been fighting to destroy?

404
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,264
I don't believe that.

405
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,471
And you're sounding like a separatist.

406
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,389
This war represents a failure to listen.

407
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,523
Now you're closer
to the chancellor than anyone.

408
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:02,901
Please, ask him to stop the fighting
and let diplomacy resume.

409
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,559
Don't ask me to do that.

410
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:10,778
Make a motion in the senate,
where that kind ofa request belongs.

411
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,702
- What is it?
- Nothing.

412
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:18,871
Don't do this.
Don't shut me out. Let me help you.

413
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:23,294
Hold me.

414
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,544
Like you did by the lake on Naboo.

415
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:30,418
So long ago,
when there was nothing but our love.

416
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,966
No politics, no plotting, no war.

417
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:16,554
- You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
- Yes, Anakin. Come closer.

418
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:19,256
I have good news.

419
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:24,727
Our clone intelligence units have discovered
the location ofGeneral Grievous.

420
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,731
He's hiding in the Utapau system.

421
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:28,733
At last.

422
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:33,318
We'll be able to capture that monster
and end this war.

423
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:36,783
I would worry about
the collective wisdom ofthe council...

424
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,284
if it didn't select you for this assignment.

425
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,737
You're the best choice, by far.

426
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:47,173
Hmm. Sit down.

427
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,170
Leave us.

428
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,059
Anakin,

429
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:07,601
you know I'm not able
to rely on theJedi Council.

430
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:13,565
Ifthey haven't included you
in their plot, they soon will.

431
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,781
I'm not sure I understand.

432
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:19,572
You must sense what I have come to suspect.

433
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:23,077
TheJedi Council want control ofthe Republic.

434
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,912
They're planning to betray me.

435
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,460
I don't think that-
Anakin.

436
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,586
Search your feelings.

437
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:37,336
You know, don't you?

438
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:44,851
I know they don't trust you.
Hmm. Or the senate.

439
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:49,772
Or the Republic, or democracy, for that matter.

440
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:54,904
I have to admit,
my trust in them has been shaken.

441
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:56,994
Why?

442
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,569
They asked you to do something...

443
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,946
that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

444
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,833
They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?

445
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,877
I don't, uh-

446
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,883
I don't know what to say.

447
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:21,545
Remember back to your early teachings.

448
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:25,926
All who gain power are afraid to lose it.

449
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:30,727
Even theJedi.
TheJedi use their power for good.

450
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:32,982
Good is a point ofview, Anakin.

451
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:38,284
The Sith and theJedi
are similar in almost every way,

452
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:43,069
including their quest for greater power.

453
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,615
The Sith rely on their passion
for their strength.

454
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,503
They think inwards- only about themselves.

455
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,916
And theJedi don't?

456
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:58,591
TheJedi are selfless.
They only care about others.

457
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:13,766
Did you ever hear the tragedy
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

458
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,444
No.
I thought not.

459
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,948
It's not a story theJedi would tell you.

460
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:26,735
It's a Sith legend.

461
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,736
Darth Plagueis...

462
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:34,498
was a dark lord ofthe Sith
so powerful and so wise,

463
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:39,464
he could use the Force
to influence the midi-chlorians...

464
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,757
to create... life.

465
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:47,465
He had such a knowledge ofthe dark side,

466
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:52,595
he could even keep the ones he cared about...

467
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,595
from dying.

468
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,740
He could actually... save people from death?

469
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:08,120
The dark side ofthe Force
is a pathway to many abilities...

470
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:12,451
some consider to be unnatural.

471
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,419
Wh- What happened to him?

472
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,589
He became so powerful,

473
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,837
the only thing he was afraid ofwas...

474
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,844
losing his power.

475
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:28,386
Which eventually, ofcourse, he did.

476
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:34,351
Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice
everything he knew.

477
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:38,145
Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.

478
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,194
It's ironic.

479
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,316
He could save others from death,

480
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,534
but not himself.

481
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:54,251
Is it possible to learn this power?

482
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,212
Not from a Jedi.

483
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,981
All Red units, over here!

484
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:33,874
Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau?

485
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:37,003
A partial message was intercepted
in a diplomatic packet...

486
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:40,253
from the chairman of Utapau.
Hmm.

487
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,094
Act on this we must.

488
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:47,920
The capture ofGeneral Grievous
will end this war.

489
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:51,889
Quickly and decisively we should proceed.

490
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:57,021
The chancellor has requested...
that I lead the campaign.

491
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:00,441
The council will make up
its own mind who is to go,

492
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,521
not the chancellor.

493
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:07,566
A master is needed, with more experience.

494
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:12,163
I concur. Master Kenobi should go.

495
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:14,621
I agree.

496
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,582
Aye.

497
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:20,464
Very well. Council adjourned.

498
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:29,220
The droids have started up
their main power generators.

499
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:34,852
Then now the time is, Commander.
Yes, sir.

500
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:49,026
Charge!

501
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,878
Head for cover!

502
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,305
You're gonna need me
on this one, Master.
Oh, I agree.

503
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:28,568
However, it may turn out
just to be a wild bantha chase.
Master.

504
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:35,821
I've disappointed you. Uh, I haven't been
very appreciative ofyour training.

505
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:40,328
I've been arrogant, and I apologize.

506
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:42,793
I'vejust been so frustrated with the council.

507
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:49,835
You are strong and wise, Anakin,
and I am very proud ofyou.

508
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:52,552
I have trained you since you were a small boy.

509
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:54,763
I have taught you everything I know.

510
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:58,604
And you have become a far greaterJedi
than I could ever hope to be.

511
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:01,391
But be patient, Anakin.

512
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:05,475
It will not be long before the council
makes you a Jedi master.

513
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:16,110
Obi-Wan. May the Force be with you.

514
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:19,118
Good-bye, old friend.
May the Force be with you.

515
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:46,232
Fortunately, most ofthe cities
are concentrated on this small continent here.

516
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:50,403
On the far side.
I'll keep them distracted until you get there.

517
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,944
Just don't take too long.
Come on. When have I
ever let you down?

518
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:55,948
Very well.

519
00:51:56,030 --> 00:52:00,530
The burden is on me not to destroy
all the droids until you arrive.

520
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,063
Save your energy.

521
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,185
I can't.

522
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,072
Don't give up, Padmé.

523
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:47,998
Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

524
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,172
He came by this morning.

525
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:53,464
What did he want?

526
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:55,506
He's worried about you.

527
00:52:57,967 --> 00:53:01,927
He says you've been
under a lot ofstress.

528
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,812
I feel lost.

529
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:09,103
Lost? What do you mean?

530
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,360
Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me.

531
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,900
They trust you with their lives.

532
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,702
Something's happening.

533
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:23,451
I'm not theJedi I should be.

534
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,746
I want more.

535
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,866
And I know I shouldn't.

536
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,960
You expect too much ofyourself.

537
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:42,144
I found a way to save you.
Save me?

538
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,179
From my nightmares.

539
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:46,223
Is that what's bothering you?

540
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,894
I won't lose you, Padmé.

541
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,057
I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.

542
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,647
I promise you.
No, I promise you.

543
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:40,987
Greetings, youngJedi.

544
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:44,530
What brings you to our remote sanctuary?

545
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,565
Unfortunately, the war.

546
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:51,249
There's no war here-
unless you brought it with you.

547
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,540
With your kind permission,
I should like some fuel...

548
00:54:54,625 --> 00:55:00,455
and to use your city as a base
as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.

549
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,805
He is here. We are being held hostage.

550
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:14,854
They are watching us.
I understand.

551
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:19,767
Tenth level, thousands of battle droids.

552
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,318
Tell your people to take shelter.

553
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:25,413
Ifyou have warriors, now is the time.

554
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:40,501
Take the fighter back to the ship.
Tell Cody I've made contact.

555
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:46,594
Is he bringing additional warriors?
He didn't say.

556
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:34,136
It won't be long before the armies
ofthe Republic track us here.

557
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:41,977
I am sending you to
the Mustafar system in the outer rim.

558
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:51,778
It is a volcanic planet.

559
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:55,197
You will be safe there.
Safe?

560
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:59,287
Hmph! Chancellor Palpatine
managed to escape your grip, General.

561
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:03,844
Without Count Dooku, I have doubts
about your ability to keep us safe.

562
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,881
Be thankful, Viceroy,

563
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,875
you have not found yourself in my grip.

564
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:16,847
Your ship is waiting.

565
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,160
Hello there.

566
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:42,379
General Kenobi.

567
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,999
You are a bold one.

568
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:48,547
Kill him.

569
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:06,476
Back away.

570
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:10,527
I will deal with thisJedi slime myself.

571
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,822
Your move.

572
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:14,816
You fool.

573
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:20,578
I've been trained in your
Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

574
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:29,587
Attack, Kenobi.

575
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,232
Go, go, go, go! Move it! Move it!

576
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:31,316
Everybody out.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

577
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,321
Coveryourself. Come on.

578
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,450
Move it! Move it!

579
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,831
Come on, move!
Come on, everybody!

580
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:48,246
Army or not,

581
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:53,455
you must realize you are doomed.

582
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,548
Oh, I don't think so.

583
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:27,248
- Uh-oh.

584
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:34,379
Hyah!

585
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,316
Cover that corner.

586
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:03,832
Master Windu, may I interrupt?

587
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,700
General Kenobi has made contact
with General Grievous,

588
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:09,078
and we have begun our attack.

589
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,576
Thankyou, Commander.

590
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,838
Anakin, deliver this report to the chancellor.

591
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,511
His reaction will give us
a clue to his intentions.

592
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:19,761
Yes, Master.

593
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,806
I sense a plot to destroy theJedi.

594
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:32,515
The dark side ofthe Force
surrounds the chancellor.

595
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:36,976
If he does not give up his emergency powers
after the destruction ofGrievous,

596
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:39,649
then he should be removed from office.

597
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:43,408
TheJedi Council
would have to take control ofthe senate...

598
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:45,662
in order to secure a peaceful transition.

599
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:50,214
To a dark place
this line ofthought will carry us.

600
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:55,960
Hmm. Great care we must take.

601
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:04,180
Chancellor.

602
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,812
We'vejust received
a report from Master Kenobi.

603
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,560
He has engaged General Grievous.

604
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:13,023
We can only hope that Master Kenobi
is up to the challenge.

605
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,856
I should be there with him.

606
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:19,322
It's upsetting to me to see that the council...

607
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:22,702
doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents.

608
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:26,911
Don't you wonder
why they won't make you a Jedi master?

609
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,578
I wish I knew.

610
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:34,423
More and more I get the feeling that...

611
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:36,751
I'm being excluded from the council.

612
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:47,678
I know there are things about the Force
that they're not telling me.

613
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:52,311
They don't trust you, Anakin.

614
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:55,104
They see your future.

615
01:02:55,188 --> 01:03:00,148
They knowyour power
will be too strong to control.

616
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:06,025
You must break through the fog of lies
theJedi have created around you.

617
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:11,445
Let me help you to know
the subtleties ofthe Force.

618
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:14,328
How do you know
the ways ofthe Force?

619
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:19,126
My mentor taught me everything about the Force.

620
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:22,212
Even the nature ofthe dark side.

621
01:03:24,176 --> 01:03:26,506
You know the dark side?

622
01:03:26,595 --> 01:03:29,045
Anakin,

623
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:32,469
ifone is to understand the great mystery,

624
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:35,139
one must study all its aspects,

625
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:38,188
notjust the dogmatic narrow view oftheJedi.

626
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:42,113
Ifyou wish to become
a complete and wise leader,

627
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:45,864
you must embrace
a largerview ofthe Force.

628
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,567
Be careful oftheJedi, Anakin.

629
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,868
Only through me...

630
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:54,832
can you achieve a power greater than anyJedi.

631
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:58,245
Learn to know the dark side ofthe Force,

632
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:01,995
and you will be able to save your wife...

633
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,168
from certain death.

634
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:07,178
What did you say?

635
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,930
Use my knowledge. I beg you.

636
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,809
You're the Sith lord.

637
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:18,773
I know what's been troubling you.
Listen to me.

638
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:23,435
Don't continue to be a pawn oftheJedi Council.

639
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:29,030
Ever since I've known you,
you've been searching for a life...

640
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:31,695
greater than that ofan ordinaryJedi.

641
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:34,195
A life ofsignificance,

642
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,657
ofconscience.

643
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:45,094
- Are you going to kill me?
- I would certainly like to.

644
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,552
I know you would.

645
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:52,465
I can feel your anger.

646
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:55,265
It gives you focus,

647
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,730
makes you stronger.

648
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:08,114
I'm going to turn you over
to theJedi Council.
Ofcourse. You should.

649
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:11,236
But you're not sure
oftheir intentions, are you?

650
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:14,914
I will quickly discover the truth ofall this.

651
01:05:14,995 --> 01:05:17,405
You have great wisdom, Anakin.

652
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:21,167
Know the power ofthe dark side.

653
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:24,041
Power to save Padmé.

654
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:55,258
Aaah!

655
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:33,718
So uncivilized.

656
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:43,274
Master Windu, I must talk to you.

657
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:47,441
Skywalker, wejust received word
that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.

658
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:51,482
We're on our way to make sure the chancellor
returns emergency power back to the senate.

659
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:55,318
He won't give up his power.
I'vejust learned a terrible truth.

660
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:58,525
I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith lord.

661
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:00,576
A Sith lord?

662
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,500
Yes. The one we've been looking for.

663
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:07,581
How do you know this?
He knows the ways ofthe Force.

664
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:09,787
He's been trained to use the dark side.

665
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,749
Are you sure?
Absolutely.

666
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:16,434
Then ourworst fears have been realized.

667
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:20,009
We must move quickly
iftheJedi order is to survive.

668
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,556
Master, the chancellor is very powerful.

669
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,930
You'll need my help
ifyou're going to arrest him.

670
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:27,978
Foryou own good, stay out ofthis affair.

671
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,862
I sense a great deal ofconfusion in you,
young Skywalker.

672
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,070
There is much fear that clouds yourjudgment.

673
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:35,403
I must go, Master.
No.

674
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:39,363
Ifwhat you've told me is true,

675
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,369
you will have gained my trust.

676
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,041
But for now, remain here.

677
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:48,035
Wait in the council chambers until we return.

678
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,585
Yes, Master.

679
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,954
You do know, don't you,

680
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:26,405
if the Jedi destroy me,

681
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:30,496
any chance ofsaving her will be lost.

682
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:03,840
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous
has been destroyed then.

683
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:07,216
I must say you're here sooner than expected.

684
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:10,925
In the name of the Galactic Senate
of the Republic,

685
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,977
you're under arrest, Chancellor.

686
01:11:13,061 --> 01:11:15,691
Are you threatening me, MasterJedi?

687
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,732
The senate will decide your fate.

688
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:21,685
- I am the senate.
- Not yet.

689
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:29,368
It's treason then.

690
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:11,888
You are under arrest, my lord.

691
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:15,562
Anakin, I told you it would come to this.

692
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:17,311
I was right.

693
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,563
TheJedi are taking over.

694
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:22,145
The oppression ofthe Sith will never return.

695
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,481
You have lost.

696
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,567
No.

697
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:30,282
No. No. You will die!

698
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:34,905
He's a traitor!

699
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:38,334
He is the traitor!

700
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:44,536
I have the power to save the one you love.

701
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:47,459
You must choose.

702
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:51,128
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

703
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:54,848
Don't let him kill me.

704
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:00,694
I can't hold it any longer.

705
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:04,020
I- I- I- I can't. I- I- I'm weak.

706
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,146
I'm- I'm too weak.

707
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:07,725
Anakin.

708
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:10,319
Help me. Help me!

709
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:16,989
I- I- I can't hold on any longer.

710
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:20,248
I am going to end this once and for all.

711
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:22,291
You can't.

712
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,325
He must stand trial.

713
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:27,838
He has control ofthe senate and the courts.

714
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:30,172
He's too dangerous to be left alive.

715
01:14:30,258 --> 01:14:34,258
I'm too weak. Oh. Don't kill me. Please.

716
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:36,255
It's not theJedi way.

717
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:37,887
He must live.

718
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,142
Please don't.

719
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:43,558
I need him.

720
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:46,864
- Please don't!
- No!

721
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:55,622
Power!

722
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:05,960
Unlimited power!

723
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:19,097
What have I done?

724
01:15:27,398 --> 01:15:31,438
You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.

725
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:35,284
Become my apprentice.

726
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:40,834
Learn to use the dark side ofthe Force.

727
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:46,456
I will do whateveryou ask.

728
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:51,089
Good.

729
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:55,377
Just help me save Padmé's life.

730
01:15:57,303 --> 01:15:59,723
I can't live without her.

731
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:07,770
To cheat death is a power
only one has achieved,

732
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:11,565
but ifwe work together...

733
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:15,491
I know we can discover the secret.

734
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:19,236
I pledge myself...

735
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:23,658
to your teachings.

736
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:28,456
Good.

737
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:41,177
The Force is strong with you.

738
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:46,853
A powerful Sith you will become.

739
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:51,226
Henceforth you shall be known as...

740
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:52,645
Darth...

741
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:55,566
Vader.

742
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:03,197
Thankyou, my master.

743
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:07,371
Rise.

744
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:25,471
Because the council did not trust you,
myyoung apprentice,

745
01:17:27,018 --> 01:17:31,808
I believe you are the onlyJedi
with no knowledge ofthis plot.

746
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:35,857
When theJedi learn what has transpired here,

747
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:37,943
they will kill us,

748
01:17:38,029 --> 01:17:40,659
along with all the senators.

749
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,740
I agree.

750
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:46,445
The council's next move
will be against the senate.

751
01:17:46,537 --> 01:17:49,537
Every singleJedi,

752
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:52,923
including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi,

753
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:56,592
is now an enemy ofthe Republic.

754
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:59,590
I understand, Master.

755
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:02,295
We must move quickly.

756
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:04,346
TheJedi are relentless.

757
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:10,270
Ifthey are not all destroyed,
it will be civil warwithout end.

758
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:15,937
First I want you to go to theJedi temple.

759
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:19,937
We will catch them off-balance.

760
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:23,994
Do what must be done, Lord Vader.

761
01:18:24,075 --> 01:18:28,075
Do not hesitate. Show no mercy.

762
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:32,962
Only then will you be strong enough
with the dark side...

763
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:35,462
to save Padmé.

764
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:40,050
What about the otherJedi
spread across the galaxy?

765
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:43,262
Their betrayal will be dealt with.

766
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:48,427
Afteryou have killed
all theJedi in the temple,

767
01:18:48,516 --> 01:18:51,226
go to the Mustafar system.

768
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:54,600
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...

769
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:58,148
and the other separatist leaders.

770
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:04,164
Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy!

771
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:07,276
And...

772
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:12,158
we shall have... peace.

773
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:58,329
Sergeant, over here!

774
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:00,499
Hurry! Follow them!

775
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,054
All Red units, let's move it!

776
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,054
Come on. Let's go!

777
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,940
Commander, contact your troops.

778
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:24,987
Tell them to move to the higher levels.

779
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:26,990
Very good, sir.

780
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:29,242
Oh, by the way,
I think you'll be needing this.

781
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:32,905
Thankyou, Cody. Now let's get a move on.
We've got a battle to win here.

782
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:34,905
Hyah!
Yes, sir.

783
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,760
Commander Cody,

784
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:47,179
the time has come.

785
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:51,509
Execute order 66.

786
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:53,597
Yes, my lord.

787
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,442
Blast him!

788
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:27,803
Come on!

789
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:22,400
Execute order 66.

790
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:24,149
It will be done, my lord.

791
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:09,230
It will be done, my lord.

792
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:48,191
Master Skywalker, there are too many ofthem.

793
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:50,273
What are we going to do?

794
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:04,914
The chancellor's office indicated
Master Anakin returned to theJedi temple.

795
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:08,128
Don't worry. I- I'm sure he'll be all right.

796
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:40,412
- What's going on here?
- There's been a rebellion, sir.

797
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:43,082
Don't worry. The situation is under control.

798
01:24:43,162 --> 01:24:46,462
I'm sorry, sir. It's time foryou to leave.

799
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:50,127
And so it is.

800
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:56,465
- Get him!

801
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:09,022
No!

802
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:15,188
Don't worry about him.
Let him go.

803
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:45,014
All these Wookiees are dead.
Move to the east.

804
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:47,098
Yes, sir.

805
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:56,611
Good-bye, Tarfful.

806
01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:58,653
Good-bye, Chewbacca.

807
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:03,409
Miss you I will.

808
01:26:40,404 --> 01:26:42,704
Hopefully we'll be able to intercept a fewJedi...

809
01:26:42,781 --> 01:26:45,201
before they walk into this catastrophe.

810
01:26:50,831 --> 01:26:52,791
Did you find Kenobi?

811
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:54,884
Sir, no one could have survived that fall.

812
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,300
Start loading your men on the ships.

813
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:01,170
Move it.

814
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:35,205
Emergency code 91 3.

815
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:37,212
I have no contact on any frequency.

816
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:41,344
Master Kenobi.

817
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:43,465
Repeat.
Master Kenobi.

818
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:47,470
Senator Organa.
My clone troops turned on me. I need help.

819
01:27:47,554 --> 01:27:50,184
We havejust rescued MasterYoda.

820
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:52,595
It appears this ambush has happened everywhere.

821
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:54,854
We're sending you our coordinates.

822
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:04,486
Hush! Not so loud.

823
01:28:04,571 --> 01:28:07,571
Are you all right?
I heard there was an attack on theJedi temple.

824
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:10,159
You could see the smoke from here.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

825
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,825
I came to see ifyou
and the baby are safe.
What's happening?

826
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:16,794
TheJedi have tried to overthrow the Republic.

827
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:19,455
I can't believe that.

828
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:24,134
I saw Master Windu attempt
to assassinate the chancellor myself.

829
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:27,716
Oh, Anakin. What are you gonna do?

830
01:28:36,395 --> 01:28:38,595
I will not betray the Republic.

831
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:42,565
My loyalties lie with the chancellor...

832
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:46,402
and with the senate and with you.

833
01:28:46,488 --> 01:28:48,698
What about Obi-Wan?

834
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:51,032
I don't know.

835
01:28:51,118 --> 01:28:53,238
ManyJedi have been killed.

836
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:57,158
We can only hope that he's remained
loyal to the chancellor.

837
01:28:57,249 --> 01:28:59,629
Anakin, I'm afraid.

838
01:29:01,545 --> 01:29:04,665
Have faith, my love.

839
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:07,086
Everything will soon be set right.

840
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:10,585
The chancellor has given me
a very important mission.

841
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:13,889
The separatists have gathered
on the Mustafar system.

842
01:29:13,974 --> 01:29:16,524
I'm going there to end this war.

843
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:18,521
Wait for me until I return.

844
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:21,023
Things will be different. I promise.

845
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:28,820
Please, wait for me.

846
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:35,618
Well, he is under a lot ofstress, R2.

847
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:39,791
Take care, my little friend.

848
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:47,755
Oh, my lady, is there anything I might do?

849
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:50,381
No, thank you, 3PO.

850
01:29:50,469 --> 01:29:55,219
Oh. I- I feel so helpless.

851
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:21,418
How many otherJedi
have managed to survive?

852
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:24,840
Heard from no one have we.

853
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:28,050
I saw thousands oftroops
attack theJedi temple.

854
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:30,051
That's why I went looking forYoda.

855
01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:32,723
Have we had any contact
from the temple?

856
01:30:32,803 --> 01:30:35,683
Received a coded retreat message we have.

857
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:39,774
It requests allJedi to return to the temple.

858
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:43,353
It says the war is over.
Well, then we must go back.

859
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:46,938
Ifthere are any stragglers,
they will fall into the trap and be killed.

860
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:51,895
Hmm. Suggest dismantling
the coded signal, do you?

861
01:30:51,988 --> 01:30:54,738
Yes, Master. There is too much at stake.

862
01:30:54,825 --> 01:30:57,405
I agree.

863
01:30:57,494 --> 01:31:01,124
And a little more knowledge might light our way.

864
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:25,520
The plan has gone
as you had promised, my lord.

865
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:28,395
You have done well, Viceroy.

866
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:34,323
When my new apprentice Darth Vader arrives,

867
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:37,946
he will take care ofyou.

868
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:52,626
We're receiving a message
from the chancellor's office, sir.

869
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:54,757
Send it through.
Yes, sir.

870
01:31:56,469 --> 01:32:01,179
Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor
requests your presence...

871
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:03,266
at a special session ofCongress.

872
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:06,941
- I will be there.
- He'll be expecting you.

873
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:13,190
- Could be a trap.
- I don't think so.

874
01:32:13,278 --> 01:32:16,408
The chancellor will not be able to control
the thousands ofstar systems...

875
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,449
without keeping the senate intact.

876
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:22,577
Ifa special session ofCongress there is,

877
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:26,332
easier for us to enter
theJedi temple it will be.

878
01:33:04,454 --> 01:33:06,464
R2, stay with the ship.

879
01:33:31,147 --> 01:33:34,897
Welcome, Lord Vader. We've been expecting you.

880
01:34:06,725 --> 01:34:11,225
And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled.

881
01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:13,654
What's happened?
The chancellor's been elaborating...

882
01:34:13,732 --> 01:34:17,072
on a plot by theJedi
to overthrow the senate.

883
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:22,662
The remaining Jedi
will be hunted down and defeated.

884
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:40,923
Not even the younglings survived.

885
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:43,970
Killed not by clones...

886
01:34:44,054 --> 01:34:47,314
this Padawan.

887
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:51,061
By a lightsaber he was.

888
01:34:57,901 --> 01:35:01,491
Who? Who could have done this?

889
01:35:12,165 --> 01:35:15,375
The attempt on my life...

890
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:18,130
has left me scarred...

891
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:21,223
and deformed.

892
01:35:21,299 --> 01:35:24,219
But I assure you.

893
01:35:24,302 --> 01:35:29,062
My resolve has never been stronger!

894
01:35:33,228 --> 01:35:37,108
Stop! No!

895
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:50,411
In order to ensure the security...

896
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:53,075
and continuing stability,

897
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:57,084
the Republic will be reorganized...

898
01:35:57,168 --> 01:36:02,628
into the first Galactic Empire!

899
01:36:02,715 --> 01:36:04,755
For a safe...

900
01:36:04,843 --> 01:36:09,433
and secure society.

901
01:36:18,815 --> 01:36:21,525
So this is how liberty dies.

902
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:24,359
With thunderous applause.

903
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:28,949
The war is over.

904
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:33,163
Lord Sidious promised us peace.
We only want-

905
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:46,006
I have recalibrated the code,
warning all survivingJedi to stay away.

906
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:48,552
For the clones...

907
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:52,756
to discover the recalibration
a long time it will take.

908
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:07,149
Wait. Master.

909
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:10,448
There is something I must know.

910
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:18,999
If into the security recordings you go,

911
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:21,003
only pain will you find.

912
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:24,585
I must know the truth, Master.

913
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:35,389
It can't be.

914
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:39,555
You have done well, my new apprentice.

915
01:37:39,646 --> 01:37:42,686
Now, Lord Vader,

916
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:46,324
go and bring peace to the Empire.

917
01:37:46,402 --> 01:37:48,572
I can't watch any more.

918
01:37:48,655 --> 01:37:53,275
Destroy the Sith we must.

919
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:57,156
Send me to kill the emperor.

920
01:37:57,247 --> 01:37:59,537
I will not kill Anakin.

921
01:37:59,624 --> 01:38:04,384
To fight this Lord Sidious,
strong enough you are not.

922
01:38:04,462 --> 01:38:07,712
He is like my brother. I cannot do it.

923
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:13,549
Twisted by the dark side
young Skywalker has become.

924
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:17,058
The boyyou trained, gone he is.

925
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:20,061
Consumed by Darth Vader.

926
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:23,194
I do not know where the emperor has sent him.

927
01:38:23,273 --> 01:38:25,523
I don't know where to look.

928
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:30,528
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan,
and find him you will.

929
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,630
When was the last time you saw him?

930
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:47,171
Yesterday.
And do you know where he is now?

931
01:38:48,214 --> 01:38:50,224
No.

932
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:53,890
Padmé, I need your help.

933
01:38:54,012 --> 01:38:57,012
He is in grave danger.
From the Sith?

934
01:38:57,098 --> 01:38:59,098
From himself.

935
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:03,599
Padmé,

936
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:06,108
Anakin has turned to the dark side.

937
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:09,690
You're wrong. How could you even say that?

938
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:16,277
I have seen a- a security hologram...

939
01:39:16,367 --> 01:39:18,827
of him...

940
01:39:18,911 --> 01:39:20,831
killing younglings.

941
01:39:20,913 --> 01:39:23,963
Not Anakin. He couldn't.

942
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:27,042
He was deceived by a lie. We all were.

943
01:39:27,128 --> 01:39:31,668
It appears that the chancellor
is behind everything, including the war.

944
01:39:33,468 --> 01:39:36,218
Palpatine is the Sith lord
we've been looking for.

945
01:39:36,304 --> 01:39:40,434
After the death ofCount Dooku,
Anakin became his new apprentice.

946
01:39:46,606 --> 01:39:48,606
I don't believe you.

947
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:51,994
I can't.

948
01:39:57,075 --> 01:39:58,235
Padmé,

949
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:01,950
I must find him.

950
01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:06,415
You're going to kill him, aren't you?

951
01:40:10,088 --> 01:40:12,588
He has become a very great threat.

952
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:17,176
I can't.

953
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:32,318
Anakin is the father, isn't he?

954
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:38,281
I'm so sorry.

955
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:25,995
Milady, let me come with you.

956
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:29,040
There's no danger.
The fighting's over. And this is personal.

957
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:31,535
As you wish, milady, but I strongly disagree.

958
01:41:31,627 --> 01:41:35,297
I'll be all right, Captain.
This is something I must do myself.

959
01:41:35,381 --> 01:41:37,801
Besides, 3PO will look after me.

960
01:41:39,635 --> 01:41:41,635
Oh, dear.

961
01:41:52,231 --> 01:41:54,361
- Do you know?

962
01:41:54,442 --> 01:41:58,072
I think I'm beginning to get the hang
ofthis flying business. Hmm.

963
01:42:25,431 --> 01:42:28,891
The separatists
have been taken care of, my master.

964
01:42:28,976 --> 01:42:31,896
It is finished then.

965
01:42:33,272 --> 01:42:39,112
You have restored
peace and justice to the galaxy.

966
01:42:39,195 --> 01:42:44,115
Send a message to the ships
ofthe Trade Federation.

967
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:49,370
All droid units
must shut down immediately.

968
01:42:49,455 --> 01:42:51,575
Very good, my lord.

969
01:43:51,475 --> 01:43:53,595
I sawyour ship.

970
01:43:56,397 --> 01:43:59,437
What are you doing out here?
I was so worried about you.

971
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:03,740
Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

972
01:44:03,821 --> 01:44:05,991
What things?

973
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:09,033
He said you've turned to the dark side.

974
01:44:09,118 --> 01:44:11,538
That you...

975
01:44:11,621 --> 01:44:13,791
killed younglings.

976
01:44:15,291 --> 01:44:17,961
Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.

977
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:21,875
He cares about us.
Us?

978
01:44:21,964 --> 01:44:24,724
He knows.

979
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,720
He wants to help you.

980
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:33,811
Anakin, all I want is your love.

981
01:44:33,893 --> 01:44:36,233
Love won't save you, Padmé.

982
01:44:36,354 --> 01:44:39,614
Only my new powers can do that.
At what cost?

983
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:42,110
You're a good person. Don't do this.

984
01:44:42,193 --> 01:44:44,943
I won't lose you the way I lost my mother.

985
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:49,279
I am becoming more powerful
than anyJedi has ever dreamed of.

986
01:44:49,367 --> 01:44:52,197
And I'm doing it foryou. To protect you.

987
01:44:53,996 --> 01:44:55,456
Come away with me.

988
01:44:55,539 --> 01:44:58,209
Help me raise our child.

989
01:44:58,334 --> 01:45:02,594
Leave everything else behind
while we still can.
Don't you see?

990
01:45:02,672 --> 01:45:05,922
We don't have to run away anymore.

991
01:45:06,008 --> 01:45:08,548
I have brought peace to the Republic.

992
01:45:08,636 --> 01:45:11,506
I am more powerful than the chancellor.

993
01:45:11,597 --> 01:45:13,717
I- I can overthrow him.

994
01:45:15,768 --> 01:45:18,848
And together, you and I can rule the galaxy,

995
01:45:18,938 --> 01:45:21,398
make things the way we want them to be.

996
01:45:27,697 --> 01:45:29,737
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

997
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:34,540
Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.

998
01:45:36,706 --> 01:45:39,576
I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan.

999
01:45:39,667 --> 01:45:43,877
TheJedi turned against me.
Don't you turn against me.

1000
01:45:45,548 --> 01:45:47,588
I don't knowyou anymore.

1001
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:51,176
Anakin,

1002
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:53,852
you're breaking my heart.

1003
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:56,931
You're going down a path I can't follow.

1004
01:45:57,017 --> 01:45:59,807
Because ofObi-Wan?

1005
01:45:59,895 --> 01:46:02,685
Because ofwhat you've done.

1006
01:46:02,773 --> 01:46:04,733
What you plan to do.

1007
01:46:05,943 --> 01:46:08,613
Stop. Stop now. Come back.

1008
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:11,656
I love you.
Liar!

1009
01:46:14,493 --> 01:46:16,373
No.

1010
01:46:16,454 --> 01:46:20,214
You're with him!
You brought him here to kill me.

1011
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:23,291
- No.
- Let her go, Anakin.

1012
01:46:24,795 --> 01:46:26,375
Anakin.

1013
01:46:26,464 --> 01:46:28,674
Let her go.

1014
01:46:38,642 --> 01:46:40,692
You turned her against me!

1015
01:46:42,271 --> 01:46:44,481
You have done that yourself.

1016
01:46:49,195 --> 01:46:51,395
You will not take her from me!

1017
01:46:51,489 --> 01:46:55,369
Your anger and your lust for power
have already done that.

1018
01:46:58,496 --> 01:47:03,666
You have allowed this dark lord
to twist your mind, until now--

1019
01:47:05,211 --> 01:47:08,421
until now you have become
the very thing you swore to destroy.

1020
01:47:08,506 --> 01:47:10,416
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.

1021
01:47:10,508 --> 01:47:13,048
I see through the lies oftheJedi.

1022
01:47:14,136 --> 01:47:16,546
I do not fear the dark side as you do.

1023
01:47:18,349 --> 01:47:20,309
I have brought peace,

1024
01:47:20,392 --> 01:47:22,102
freedom,justice...

1025
01:47:22,186 --> 01:47:26,056
and security to my new empire.

1026
01:47:26,148 --> 01:47:29,028
Your new empire?

1027
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:32,449
Don't make me kill you.

1028
01:47:32,530 --> 01:47:37,080
Anakin, my allegiance
is to the Republic, to democracy!

1029
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:39,789
Ifyou're not with me,

1030
01:47:40,788 --> 01:47:42,708
then you're my enemy.

1031
01:47:44,708 --> 01:47:47,208
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

1032
01:47:49,797 --> 01:47:51,257
I will do what I must.

1033
01:47:52,299 --> 01:47:54,719
You will try.

1034
01:48:26,458 --> 01:48:30,498
I hear a new apprentice you have, Emperor.

1035
01:48:30,588 --> 01:48:35,088
Or should I call you Darth Sidious?

1036
01:48:35,175 --> 01:48:37,425
MasterYoda.

1037
01:48:37,511 --> 01:48:39,601
You survived.

1038
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:42,430
Surprised?

1039
01:48:42,516 --> 01:48:47,146
Your arrogance blinds you, MasterYoda.

1040
01:48:47,229 --> 01:48:49,309
Now you will experience...

1041
01:48:49,398 --> 01:48:53,898
the full power ofthe dark side.

1042
01:49:35,819 --> 01:49:39,529
I have waited a long time...

1043
01:49:39,615 --> 01:49:42,195
for this moment,

1044
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:46,834
my little green friend.

1045
01:49:55,839 --> 01:50:00,509
- At last the Jedi are no more.

1046
01:50:00,594 --> 01:50:04,854
Not if anything
to say about it I have.

1047
01:50:04,932 --> 01:50:06,312
Aaah!

1048
01:50:09,436 --> 01:50:12,516
At an end your rule is.

1049
01:50:14,358 --> 01:50:16,818
And not short enough it was.

1050
01:50:21,615 --> 01:50:23,825
If so powerful you are,

1051
01:50:25,035 --> 01:50:26,325
why leave?

1052
01:50:27,454 --> 01:50:30,044
You will not stop me.

1053
01:50:30,124 --> 01:50:34,754
Darth Vader will become
more powerful than either of us.

1054
01:50:34,837 --> 01:50:39,217
Faith in your new apprentice
misplaced may be.

1055
01:50:40,509 --> 01:50:44,599
As is your faith
in the dark side of the Force.

1056
01:55:12,197 --> 01:55:14,947
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.

1057
01:55:15,033 --> 01:55:17,873
Activate your homing beacon when you're ready.

1058
01:55:17,953 --> 01:55:20,333
There's no sign of his body, sir.

1059
01:55:20,414 --> 01:55:24,084
Then he is not dead.
Double your search.

1060
01:55:24,167 --> 01:55:26,417
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

1061
01:55:26,503 --> 01:55:31,593
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle
for immediate takeoff.

1062
01:55:31,717 --> 01:55:36,847
Yes, Master.
I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

1063
01:56:45,624 --> 01:56:49,424
Into exile I must go.

1064
01:56:49,503 --> 01:56:51,633
Failed I have.

1065
01:58:31,021 --> 01:58:32,981
I have failed you, Anakin.

1066
01:58:33,064 --> 01:58:34,984
I have failed you.

1067
01:58:35,066 --> 01:58:37,986
I should have known the Jedi
were plotting to take over.

1068
01:58:38,069 --> 01:58:40,909
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

1069
01:58:40,989 --> 01:58:43,659
From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.

1070
01:58:43,742 --> 01:58:45,372
Well, then you are lost!

1071
01:58:57,214 --> 01:58:59,764
This is the end for you, my master.

1072
01:59:24,241 --> 01:59:28,411
It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.

1073
01:59:30,038 --> 01:59:32,748
You underestimate my power.

1074
01:59:34,084 --> 01:59:35,254
Don't try it.

1075
01:59:58,191 --> 02:00:00,111
You were the chosen one!

1076
02:00:01,570 --> 02:00:05,030
It was said that you would destroy the Sith,
not join them!

1077
02:00:07,409 --> 02:00:09,489
Bring balance to the Force,

1078
02:00:09,578 --> 02:00:12,118
not leave it in darkness!

1079
02:00:22,882 --> 02:00:24,842
I hate you!

1080
02:00:32,809 --> 02:00:34,979
You were my brother, Anakin.

1081
02:00:36,980 --> 02:00:39,360
I loved you.

1082
02:01:19,189 --> 02:01:21,189
Oh. Master Kenobi.

1083
02:01:21,274 --> 02:01:23,574
Um, we have Miss Padmé on board.

1084
02:01:23,652 --> 02:01:26,202
Yes. Please, please hurry.

1085
02:01:26,279 --> 02:01:28,489
We should leave this dreadful place.

1086
02:01:40,502 --> 02:01:42,502
Obi-Wan.

1087
02:01:44,005 --> 02:01:46,215
Is Anakin all right?

1088
02:02:54,784 --> 02:02:57,624
Your Majesty, this way.

1089
02:02:57,704 --> 02:02:59,624
There he is.

1090
02:02:59,706 --> 02:03:01,916
He's still alive.

1091
02:03:04,878 --> 02:03:07,128
Get a medical capsule immediately.

1092
02:03:07,213 --> 02:03:09,213
Yes, sir. Right away.

1093
02:03:45,502 --> 02:03:47,132
Excuse me, MasterYoda.

1094
02:03:53,009 --> 02:03:55,219
Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.

1095
02:04:12,028 --> 02:04:14,488
We'll take her to the medical center. Quickly.

1096
02:04:44,018 --> 02:04:47,018
Medically, she's completely healthy.

1097
02:04:47,105 --> 02:04:50,355
For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.

1098
02:04:51,693 --> 02:04:54,443
She's dying?
We don't know why.

1099
02:04:54,529 --> 02:04:56,609
She has lost the will to live.

1100
02:04:56,698 --> 02:04:59,868
We need to operate quickly
if we are to save the babies.

1101
02:04:59,951 --> 02:05:01,581
Babies?

1102
02:05:01,661 --> 02:05:03,581
She's carrying twins.

1103
02:05:43,161 --> 02:05:45,621
Ee-see-tah oy-doh.

1104
02:05:45,705 --> 02:05:48,495
Luke.

1105
02:05:55,381 --> 02:05:58,971
Oh, Luke.

1106
02:06:02,472 --> 02:06:06,732
Ooh-bah, ooh-bah.

1107
02:06:06,851 --> 02:06:10,271
Ooh-bah.

1108
02:06:16,277 --> 02:06:19,197
Ee-see-tah oy-dah.

1109
02:06:19,322 --> 02:06:22,282
It's a girl.
Leia.

1110
02:07:04,242 --> 02:07:05,662
Obi-Wan?

1111
02:07:11,124 --> 02:07:13,044
There's good in him.

1112
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:17,672
I know.

1113
02:07:17,755 --> 02:07:20,375
I know there's...

1114
02:07:20,466 --> 02:07:22,466
still-

1115
02:07:56,627 --> 02:07:59,337
Lord Vader.

1116
02:07:59,422 --> 02:08:01,552
Can you hear me?

1117
02:08:04,594 --> 02:08:07,104
Yes, Master.

1118
02:08:09,182 --> 02:08:12,022
Where is Padmé?

1119
02:08:12,101 --> 02:08:14,811
Is she safe?

1120
02:08:15,897 --> 02:08:17,937
Is she all right?

1121
02:08:19,609 --> 02:08:24,199
It seems, in your anger, you killed her.

1122
02:08:25,198 --> 02:08:28,118
I? I couldn't have.

1123
02:08:28,201 --> 02:08:31,241
She was alive. I felt it!

1124
02:08:50,973 --> 02:08:55,313
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoOoOooOOooOoOooooooooooooooooo!

1125
02:09:05,154 --> 02:09:08,954
Hidden, safe the children must be kept.

1126
02:09:10,576 --> 02:09:14,156
We must take them somewhere
where the Sith will not sense their presence.

1127
02:09:15,248 --> 02:09:19,208
Hmm. Split up they should be.

1128
02:09:19,293 --> 02:09:21,463
My wife and I will take the girl.

1129
02:09:23,005 --> 02:09:26,335
We've always talked ofadopting a baby girl.

1130
02:09:26,425 --> 02:09:28,295
She will be loved with us.

1131
02:09:29,554 --> 02:09:31,184
And what ofthe boy?

1132
02:09:32,181 --> 02:09:35,641
To Tatooine. To his family send him.

1133
02:09:37,436 --> 02:09:39,896
I will take the child and watch over him.

1134
02:09:45,361 --> 02:09:49,031
Until the time is right, disappear we will.

1135
02:09:50,825 --> 02:09:54,445
Master Kenobi, wait a moment.

1136
02:09:55,955 --> 02:10:01,205
In your solitude on Tatooine,
training I have foryou.

1137
02:10:02,587 --> 02:10:03,837
Training?

1138
02:10:03,921 --> 02:10:08,551
An old friend has learned the path to immortality.

1139
02:10:10,553 --> 02:10:13,683
One who has returned
from the netherworld ofthe Force.

1140
02:10:13,764 --> 02:10:16,314
Your old master.

1141
02:10:16,392 --> 02:10:18,392
Qui-Gon?

1142
02:10:20,897 --> 02:10:24,187
How to commune with him I will teach you.

1143
02:10:25,651 --> 02:10:27,821
Captain Antilles.
Yes, Your Highness?

1144
02:10:27,904 --> 02:10:29,824
I'm placing these droids in your care.

1145
02:10:29,906 --> 02:10:31,816
Treat them well. Clean them up.

1146
02:10:31,908 --> 02:10:33,778
Have the protocol droid's mind wiped.

1147
02:10:33,910 --> 02:10:35,410
What?

1148
02:10:37,246 --> 02:10:39,246
Oh, no.
