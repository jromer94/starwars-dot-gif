1
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,410
Captain.
Yes, sir?

2
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,668
Tell them we wish to board at once.

3
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,461
With all due respect,

4
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,964
the ambassadors for the supreme chancellor
wish to board immediately.

5
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,968
Yes, of course.

6
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,180
As you know, our blockade is perfectly legal,

7
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:20,391
and we'd be happy to receive the ambassadors.

8
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,499
I'm TC-1 4 at your service.

9
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,502
This way, please.

10
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,680
We are greatly honored by your visit, Ambassadors.

11
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,680
Make yourselves comfortable.

12
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,972
My master will be with you shortly.

13
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:07,267
I have a bad feeling about this.

14
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:10,436
I don't sense anything.
It's not about the mission, Master.

15
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:14,494
It's something... elsewhere, elusive.

16
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,990
Don't center on your anxieties, Obi-Wan.

17
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:20,242
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

18
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,195
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

19
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,327
But not at the expense of the moment.

20
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,374
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

21
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,418
Yes, Master.

22
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:36,258
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

23
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,511
These Federation types are cowards.

24
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,474
The negotiations will be short.

25
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,845
What? What did you say?

26
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,943
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

27
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,940
I knew it.

28
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,272
They're here to force a settlement.

29
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:56,437
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

30
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,448
Are you brain-dead?

31
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,450
I'm not going in there with two Jedi.

32
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,494
Send a droid.

33
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,785
Is it in their nature to make us wait this long?

34
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:16,507
No. I sense an unusual amount of fear
for something as trivial as this trade dispute.

35
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,312
What is it?

36
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,064
This scheme of yours has failed, Lord Sidious.

37
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:35,727
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

38
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:40,697
Viceroy, I don't want this stunted slime
in my sight again.

39
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,582
This turn of events is unfortunate.

40
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,790
We must accelerate our plans.
Begin landing your troops.

41
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:52,632
My lord, is that legal?

42
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,039
I will make it legal.

43
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,458
And the Jedi?

44
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,967
The chancellor should never
have brought them into this.
Kill them immediately.

45
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:06,392
Yes. Yes, my lord. Uh, as you wish.

46
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,023
Captain, look!

47
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,562
Shields up!

48
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,904
Sorry.

49
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,571
Dioxis.

50
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,040
They must be dead by now.

51
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:33,081
Destroy what's left of them.

52
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,343
Oh! Excuse me.

53
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,386
- Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
- Roger, roger.

54
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,060
Uh-oh. Blast them.

55
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,348
What is going on down there?

56
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,439
We lost the transmission, sir.

57
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,952
Have you ever encountered a Jedi knight before, sir?

58
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,991
Well, no, but I don't— Seal off the bridge.

59
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,828
Yes, sir.
That won't be enough, sir.

60
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,912
I want droidekas up here at once!

61
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,618
We will not survive this.

62
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,597
Close the blast doors!

63
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,349
That will hold them.

64
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,572
They are still coming through.

65
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,618
This is impossible!

66
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,960
Where are those droidekas?

67
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,303
Master! Destroyers!

68
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,427
They have shield generators!

69
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,224
It's a standoff. Let's go.

70
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,935
They're no match for droidekas.

71
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:24,533
Sir! They've gone up the ventilation shaft.

72
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,996
Battle droids.
It's an invasion army.

73
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,377
This is an odd play for the Trade Federation.

74
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,630
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

75
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:48,633
Let's split up. Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

76
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,638
You were right about one thing, Master.

77
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,221
The negotiations were short.

78
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,813
Sir, a transmission from the planet.

79
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,015
It's Queen Amidala herself.

80
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:04,816
At last we are getting results.

81
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,951
Again you come before us, Your Highness.

82
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,159
You will not be so pleased
when you hear what I have to say, Viceroy.

83
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,991
Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.

84
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,658
I was not aware of such failure.

85
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,497
I have word that the chancellor's ambassadors
are with you now...

86
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,344
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.

87
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,710
I know nothing of any ambassadors.

88
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,217
You must be mistaken.

89
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,340
Beware, Viceroy.

90
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,137
The Federation has gone too far this time.

91
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:37,311
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

92
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,982
You assume too much.

93
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,901
We will see.

94
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:47,033
She's right. The senate will never--
It's too late now.

95
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,152
Do you think she suspects an attack?
I don't know.

96
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:54,658
But we must move quickly
to disrupt all communications down there.

97
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:03,917
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

98
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,212
How could that be true?

99
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:10,666
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

100
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,509
It must— handiwork— negotiate— ambassadors—

101
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,308
nobody would—
Senator Palpatine.

102
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,310
What's happening?

103
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,312
Check the transmission generator.

104
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:26,274
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

105
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,688
The Federation would not dare go that far.

106
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,657
The senate would revoke their trade franchise,
and they'd be finished.

107
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,619
We must continue to rely on negotiation.

108
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,950
Negotiation? We've lost all communications.

109
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,367
And where are the chancellor's ambassadors?

110
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,167
This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness.

111
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,671
Our security volunteers will be no match
against a battle-hardened Federation army.

112
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:55,836
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

113
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,509
- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship,

114
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,722
and there is no trace of the Jedi.

115
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,603
They may have gotten on one of your landing craft.

116
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,181
If they're down here, sir, we'll find them.

117
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:47,147
Use caution.
These Jedi are not to be underestimated.

118
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,002
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

119
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,171
Get down!

120
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,539
Ay-yee-yee! Wha!

121
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,641
Was'n dat? Hey, wait!

122
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,675
Oh, mooie-mooie! I love you!

123
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,974
You almost got us killed. Are you brainless?

124
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,809
I spake.
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

125
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,856
Now, get out of here.
No, no, mesa stay.

126
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,979
Mesa culled JarJar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

127
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,239
That won't be necessary.
Oh, but it 'tis.

128
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,240
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

129
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,783
Oh, no! Whoo!
Stay down!

130
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,327
You saved my again.

131
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,340
What's this?
A local.

132
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:56,222
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.
More?

133
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,549
"More" did you spake?

134
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:03,555
Ex-squeeze-me,
but de mostest safest place would be Gunga City.

135
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,890
Is where I grew up. 'Tis a hidden city.

136
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,348
A city?
Uh-huh.

137
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,650
Can you take us there?
Uh, on second thought, no.

138
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,244
Not really, no.
No?

139
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,490
'Tis embarrassing,

140
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,582
but, uh, my afraid my've been banished.

141
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,790
My forgotten.
Da bosses would do terrible tings to me.

142
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,961
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

143
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,131
You hear that?
Yah.

144
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:37,011
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

145
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,680
If they find us, they will crush us,

146
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,349
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

147
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,350
Oh. Yousa point is well seen.

148
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,854
This way. Hurry!

149
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,439
How much further?
Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

150
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,449
Ah, my warning you.

151
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:05,701
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

152
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,115
Oh, don't worry.
This hasn't been our day for warm welcomes.

153
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:13,165
Ar, ar, ar! Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

154
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,007

Ohh.

00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,552
Ay,ay.

164
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,843
How wude.

165
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,904
Tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk!
Yousa cannot bees hair.

166
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:02,531
Dis army of Mackineeks up dare is new weesong.

167
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,530
A droid army is about to attack the Naboo.
We must warn them.

168
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:11,285
Wesa no like da Naboo.
Tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk.

169
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:14,159
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

170
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,207
Day tink day brains so big.

171
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:21,462
Once those droids take control of the surface,
they will take control of you.

172
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,916
Mesa no tink so.

173
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,877
Day not know of uss-en.

174
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,968
You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle.

175
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,474
What happens to one of you will affect the other.
You must understand this.

176
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:38,348
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

177
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,018
Then speed us on our way.

178
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,687
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

179
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,566
We could use a transport.

180
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,494
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

181
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,735
Hmm?
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

182
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:57,617
'tis goen through the planet core.

183
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,577
Now...

184
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,537
go.

185
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,877
Thank you for your help. We leave in peace.

186
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,093
Master, what's a bongo?

187
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,184
A transport, I hope.

188
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,339
Deysa setten yousa up.

189
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:14,138
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

190
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:18,393
Mmm... any help here would be hot.

191
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,609
Master, we're short on time.

192
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,399
We'll need a navigator
to get us through the planet's core.

193
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,435
This Gungan may be of help.

194
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,662
What is to become ofJarJar Binks here?

195
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:37,622
Hisen to be pune-ished.

196
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,997
Ohh.
I saved his life.

197
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,583
He owes me what you call a "life-debt."

198
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,548
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

199
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,051
Binkssssss,

200
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,763
yousa havena liveplay with thisen hisen?

201
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,255
Mm, uh-huh.

202
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,732
Begone wit him!

203
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,775
Count me outta dis one.

204
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,029
Better dead here than dead in da core.

205
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:13,283
Yee gods! What mesa sayin?

206
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,257
Dis is nutsen. Oh, gooberfish!

207
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,637
Why were you banished,JarJar?
It's a longo tale-o,

208
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:42,813
buta small part of it would be mesa... clumsy.

209
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:47,765
- You were banished because you were clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

210
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:04,921
Mesa caused mabbe
one, two-y lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

211
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,091
Yud-say boom da gassar,

212
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,010
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

213
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:17,137
- Wuh-oh!

214
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,351
Big gooberfish! Huge-o teeth!

215
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:34,197
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

216
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,791
The invasion is on schedule, my lord.

217
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,878
I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.

218
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,474
They will have no choice
but to accept your control of the system.

219
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:01,262
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

220
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,389
Queen Amidala is young and naive.

221
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,937
You will find controlling her will not be difficult.

222
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,982
Yes, my lord.

223
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,319
You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi.

224
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:18,953
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

225
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:27,171
Where wesa goin?
Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

226
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,040
Ohh, maxi big, da Force.

227
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,917
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

228
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,007
We're losing power.

229
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,761
Ohhh, no!

230
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,930
Wesa dyin' here.

231
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,729
Just relax.
We're not in trouble yet.
What "yet"?

232
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,862
Monsters out dare. Leak'n in here.

233
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,940
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

234
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,534
Power's back.
Huh?

235
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,695
Aah, monster's back!

236
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,833
Relax.

237
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,920
Ohh.
You overdid it.

238
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,692
Horrible.
Head for that outcropping.

239
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,771
Oh, boy.

240
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,140
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

241
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,978
Ah, victory.

242
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,617
Mmm, dis'n loverly.

243
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:38,172
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

244
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:42,465
The queen and I will sign a treaty
that will legitimize our occupation here.

245
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,721
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

246
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:49,346
I will not cooperate.
Now, now, Your Highness.

247
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:53,563
In time, the suffering of your people
will persuade you to see our point of view.

248
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,817
Commander.
Yes, sir.

249
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,531
Process them.
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

250
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,571
Roger, roger.

251
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,452
Whoops!

252
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,991
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

253
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:01,094
- We should leave the street, Your Highness.
- Get their weapons.

254
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:04,722
Whoa! Yousa guys bombad!

255
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,222
We're ambassadors for the supreme chancellor.

256
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,215
Your negotiations seemed to have failed, Ambassador.

257
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,137
The negotiations never took place.

258
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,635
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

259
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:19,188
- They've knocked out all our communications.
- Do you have transports?

260
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,733
In the main hangar. This way.

261
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,408
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

262
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:33,042
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

263
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,250
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

264
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,082
-They will kill you if you stay.
-They wouldn't dare.

265
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,918
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.
They can't afford to kill her.

266
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,165
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

267
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,257
There's no logic in the Federation's move here.

268
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,303
My feelings tell me they will destroy you.

269
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,846
Our only hope is for the senate to side with us.

270
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,391
Senator Palpatine will need your help.

271
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:58,515
Either choice presents great danger... to us all.

272
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,524
We are brave, Your Highness.

273
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,856
If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now.

274
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,443
Then I will plead our case to the senate.

275
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:09,319
Be careful, Governor.

276
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:21,417
We'll need to free those pilots.

277
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,462
I'll deal with that.

278
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,382
Halt!
I'm ambassador to
the supreme chancellor.

279
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,468
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

280
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:34,814
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

281
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,560
Coruscant? Uh, that doesn't compute.

282
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,563
Uh, wait. You're under arrest.

283
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,364
Come on. Move!

284
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,235
Go!

285
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:21,482
Now, stay here and keep out of trouble.

286
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,402
Hello, boyos.

287
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,409
There's the blockade.

288
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,419
- The shield generator's been hit!

289
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,508
How wude!

290
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,114
We're losing droids fast.

291
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:12,613
If we can't get the shield generator fixed,
we'll be sitting ducks.

292
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:18,828
- The shields are gone.

293
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:25,455
The power's back!

294
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:31,762
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

295
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,470
Deflector shields up at maximum.

296
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:47,728
There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant.
The hyperdrive is leaking.

297
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:50,725
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

298
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,028
Here, Master. Tatooine.

299
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:56,742
Small, out of the way, poor.
The Trade Federation have no presence there.

300
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,704
How can you be sure?

301
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,744
It's controlled by the Hutts.

302
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:03,708
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

303
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,119
- If they discovered her--
- It'd be no different than if we landed...

304
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,078
on a system controlled by the Federation,

305
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:12,548
except that the Hutts aren't looking for her,
which gives us the advantage.

306
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:20,009
And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty?

307
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:23,807
She has disappeared, my lord.

308
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:28,062
One Naboo cruiser got past the blockade.

309
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:31,147
I want that treaty signed.

310
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,323
My lord,

311
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,992
it's impossible to locate the ship.

312
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,321
It's out of our range.

313
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:41,157
Not for a Sith.

314
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,163
This is my apprentice,

315
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,195
Darth Maul.

316
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:49,827
He will find your lost ship.

317
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,471
This is getting out of hand.

318
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,590
Now there are two of them.

319
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,757
We should not have made this bargain.

320
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:10,607
An extremely well-put-together little droid,
Your Highness.

321
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,609
Without a doubt,
it saved the ship, as well as our lives.

322
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,032
It is to be commended. What is its number?

323
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,868
R2-D2, Your Highness.

324
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:27,080
- Thank you, R2-D2.

325
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:30,004
Padmé.

326
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,254
Clean this droid up as best you can.

327
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,336
It deserves our gratitude.

328
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,720
Continue, Captain.

329
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,220
Your Highness, with your permission,

330
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:45,394
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

331
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,814
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

332
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,564
I do not agree with the Jedi on this.

333
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,607
You must trust my judgment, Your Highness.

334
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,696
Hello.

335
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,780
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

336
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,366
I'm Padmé.

337
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,502
Mesa JarJar Binks.

338
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,620
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

339
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,787
Uh-huh.

340
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:16,548
How'd you end up here with us?
My no know.

341
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:20,340
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.

342

Huh. Mesa getten berry, berry scared.

345
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,901
That's it— Tatooine.
There's a settlement.

346
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:44,157
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

347
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,223
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

348
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,763
That'll complicate things. Be wary.

349
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:10,059
I sense a disturbance in the Force.
I feel it also, Master.

350
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:13,022
Don't let them send any transmissions.

351
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,735
This sun doen murder to mesa skin.

352
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,319
Wait!

353
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,355
Wait.

354
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,123
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

355
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:35,035
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

356
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,205
The spaceport is not going to be pleasant.

357
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,504
The queen wishes it.

358
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,548
She's curious about the planet.

359
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:45,131
This is not a good idea.

360
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,179
Stay close to me.

361
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,823
Moisture farms, for the most part.

362
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:08,822
Some indigenous tribes and scavengers.

363
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:13,249
The few spaceports like this one
are havens for those that don't wish to be found.

364
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,290
Like us.

365
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,213
Dissen berry berry bad.

366
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,514
Oh! Icky icky goo!

367
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,767
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

368
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,605
Good day to you.

369
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,534
What do you want?

370
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,735
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

371
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,957
Ah, yes! Nubian. We have lots of that.

372
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,543
Boy, get in here now!

373
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,535
My droid has a readout of what I need.

374
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,840
What took you so long?

375
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,049
I was cleaning the fan switches.

376
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,684
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

377
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:13,311
So... let me take thee out back, huh?

378
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,270
Ni you'll find what you need.

379
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,774
Hmm?
Don't touch anything.

380
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,805
Hmph!

381
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,899
Hmm.

382
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:32,781
Are you an angel?
What?

383
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:36,618
An angel.
I heard the deep space pilots
talk about them.

384
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,615
They're the most beautiful creatures
in the universe.

385
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,288
They live on the moons of Iego, I think.

386
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,747
You're a funny little boy.

387
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,798
How do you know so much?

388
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:50,762
I listen to all the traders and star pilots
who come through here.

389
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:55,144
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

390
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:59,225
You're a pilot?
Mm-hmm. All my life.

391
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,691
How long have you been here?

392
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:05,822
Since I was very little. Three, I think.

393
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,651
My mom and I were sold to Gardulla the Hutt,

394
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:11,447
but she lost us betting on the Pod-races.

395
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,321
You're a slave?

396
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:17,660
I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
I'm sorry.

397
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:21,496
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

398
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:24,343
Hmm. Hmm.

399
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,839
Where— Wheres yousa goin?

400
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,304
Ugh!

401
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,467
I got ya.
Hey!

402
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,345
What?
Hit the nose.

403
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,022
Oh! Uh.

404
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,610
A T-1 4 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

405
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,360
I'm the only one hereabouts who has one.

406
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,953
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, huh?

407
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,030
Saying of which,

408
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:57,487
how's thee gonna pay for all this, huh?

409
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,697
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

410
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,658
Republic credits?

411
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,708
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

412
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,923
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

413
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,716
No, they won't.
Credits will do fine.

414
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,630
No, they won't!

415
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:17,968
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

416
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:22,306
I'm a Toydarian.
Mind tricks don't work on me. Only money.

417
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:26,564
No money, no parts, no deal.

418
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:31,188
And no one else has a T-1 4 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

419
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:41,834
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

420
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,423
Oh! Aw! Ooh! Uh!

421
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:48,131
Ai, ai! Whoa, ai!
We're leaving.JarJar.

422
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,461
Whaaa!

423
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:53,127
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

424
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,126
I was glad to meet you too.

425
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,220
What? Wha— Oh.

426
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:08,023
Outlanders. They think we know nothing.

427
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,066
They seemed nice to me.

428
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,110
Clean the racks...

429
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:13,574
...then you can go home.

430
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,533
Yippee!

431
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,945
And you're sure there's nothing left on board?

432
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,959
A few containers of supplies.

433
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:29,131
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with,

434
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,551
not in the amount you're talking about.

435
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,130
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

436
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,086
I'll check back later.

437
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,586
Noah gain! Noah gain.

438
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,508
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

439
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:44,138
Wesa be wobbed un crunched!

440
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:47,386
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

441
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,280
Hmm? Ah, mooie-mooie.

442
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,539
Hey, hey!

443
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,079
Are you going to pay for that?

444
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,002
Huh? Wanga?

445
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,961
It costs seven wupiupi.

446
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,169
Ah! Chubaa—

447
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:15,585
Oops.

448
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:21,051
Is this yours?

449
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,847
Who, mesa?

450
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,891
Ouch! Ouch!

451
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:29,137
Careful, Sebulba.

452
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,269
He's a big-time outlander.

453
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,936
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

454
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,946
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

455
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,120
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

456
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:45,664
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

457
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,916
- Hi.
- Hi there.

458
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,880
Your buddy here was about to be
turned into orange goo.

459
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:56,461
He picked a fight with a Dug,
an especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba.

460
00:36:56,548 --> 00:37:00,218
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

461
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:04,352
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

462
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,311
Thanks, my young friend.

463
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,481
But— But—

464
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,980
But mesa doen nutten!

465
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,607
This storm will slow them down.

466
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:24,408
Looks pretty bad.

467
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:27,124
Panaka.
Receiving a message from home.

468
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,463
We'll be right there.

469
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,548
Here, you'll like these pallies.

470
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:40,301
Here.
Thank you.

471
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,716
Oh, my bones are aching.

472
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:48,353
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

473
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:51,385
Do you have shelter?
We'll head back to our ship.

474
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:54,098
Is it far?
It's on the outskirts.

475
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,609
You'll never reach the outskirts in time.

476
00:37:56,691 --> 00:38:00,611
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

477
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,195
Come on. I'll take you to my place.

478
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,091
Mom!

479
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:22,882
Mom, I'm home!
Ahh, dissen cozy.

480
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,389
These are my friends, Mom.
Hello.

481
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:29,102
I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

482
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,562
Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter.

483
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:35,185
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.
Oh, mooie-mooie.

484
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:46,162
Isn't he great? He's not finished yet.

485
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,121
He's wonderful.

486
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:51,123
You really like him?

487
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:54,214
He's a protocol droid to help Mom. Watch.

488
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:59,875
Oh. Oh. Uh— Where is everybody?

489
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:03,303
Whoops. Yeah.

490
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,593
Oh, hello.

491
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:09,007
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

492
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,967
How might I serve you?

493
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,929
He's perfect.
Oh. Perfect.

494
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,558
When the storm is over,
I'll show you my racer.
I'm building a Pod-racer.

495
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:21,527
- I'm not sure this floor is entirely stable.

496
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,819
Oh, hello.
I don't believe we have been introduced.

497
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,028
R2-D2. A pleasure to meet you.

498
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,157
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

499
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,999
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

500
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:42,959
My parts are showing? My goodness! Oh!

501
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,050
The death toll is catastrophic.

502
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,508
We must bow to their wishes.

503
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,679
You must contact me.

504
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:57,518
It's a trick. Send no reply.

505
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:01,114
Send no transmissions of any kind.

506
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:04,781
It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace.

507
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:08,861
What if it is true, and the people are dying?

508
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,488
Either way, we're running out of time.

509
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,259
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

510
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,182
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

511
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,181
Move against the Jedi first.

512
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,023
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

513
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,019
to sign the treaty.

514
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,311
At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi.

515
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,855
At last we will have revenge.

516
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,860
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

517
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,363
They will be no match for you.

518
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:57,200
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

519
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,288
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

520
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,916
Any attempt to escape—
And they blow you up!

521
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,463
Boom!
How wude!

522
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:09,008
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

523
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,012
The Republic's antislavery lawS—

524
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,474
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

525
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:16,595
We must survive on our own.

526
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:19,353
Excuse me.

527
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,855
Has anybody ever seen a Pod-race?

528
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:27,609
They have Pod-racing on Malastare.
Very fast, very dangerous.

529
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,284
I'm the only human who can do it.

530
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:33,573
You must have Jedi reflexes if you race pods.

531
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,948
Don't do that again.

532
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:43,964
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

533
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,464
What makes you think that?

534
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:52,838
I saw your laser sword.
Only Jedis carry that kind of weapon.

535
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,847
Perhaps I killed a Jedi and took it from him.

536
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,850
I don't think so.

537
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,102
No one can kill a Jedi.

538
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,024
I wish that were so.

539
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,194
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

540
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:08,403
I came back here and freed all the slaves.

541
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,946
Have you come to free us?
No, I'm afraid not.

542
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,410
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

543
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,997
I can see there's no fooling you, Anakin.

544
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:27,173
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic,

545
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,253
on a very important mission.

546
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:32,469
How did you end up out here in the outer rim?

547
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,180
Our ship was damaged,
and we're stranded here
until we can repair it.

548
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,392
I can help.

549
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:42,274
I can fix anything.
I believe you can.

550
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:45,232
But first we must acquire the parts we need.

551
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:48,073
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

552
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:51,689
These junk dealers must have
a weakness of some kind.

553
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:56,278
Gambling. Everything here revolves around
betting on those awful races.

554
00:42:56,366 --> 00:43:00,576
Pod-racing. Greed can be a powerful ally.

555
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:03,582
I built a racer. It's the fastest ever.

556
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:06,165
There's a big race tomorrow on Boonta Eve.

557
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,882
You could enter my pod.
Anakin!

558
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:12,092
- Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

559
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,053
You could make him think it was yours...

560
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,433
and get him to let me pilot it for you.

561
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:20,721
I don't want you to race. It's awful.
I die every time Watto makes you do it.

562
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,017
But, Mom, I love it.

563
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:26,651
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

564
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,059
Anakin.

565
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,978
Your mother's right.

566
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:35,198
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

567
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:38,409
No.

568
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:48,043
Mom, you say the biggest problem
in this universe is nobody helps each other.

569
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,796
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

570
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,803
We'll find some other way.

571
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,175
No.

572
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,763
There is no other way.

573
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:07,189
I may not like it, but he can help you.

574
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,900
He was meant to help you.

575
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,374
Are you sure about this?

576
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:28,165
Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know?

577
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,289
The queen will not approve.

578
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,336
The queen doesn't need to know.

579
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,011
Well, I don't approve.

580
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:38,841
The boy tells me you want to
sponsor him in the race.

581
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:43,966
How can you do this?
Not on the Republic credits, I think, huh?

582
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:46,267
My ship will be the entry fee.

583
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,480
Oh, not bad!

584
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:51,561
Not bad, huh? A Nubian, huh?

585
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,977
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

586
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:57,608
What would the boy ride?

587
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:01,275
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It will take some long time to fix it.

588
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:05,535
It wasn't my fault, really.
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

589
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,040
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

590
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,633
Mmm. That you did, huh.

591
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,550
The boy's good. No doubts there, huh?

592
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,970
I have acquired a pod in a game of chance,
the fastest ever built.

593
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:25,181
I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it, huh?

594
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,231
So, you supply the pod and the entry fee,

595
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:32,231
and I supply the boy.

596
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:36,233
We split the winnings,
um, 50-50, I think, huh?

597
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:40,987
If it's going to be 50-50,
I suggest you front the cash for the entry.

598
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,162
If we win,

599
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:47,081
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

600
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:50,411
And if we lose, you keep my ship.

601
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,246
Either way, you win.

602
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:02,379
Deal!

603
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,851
Your friend is a foolish one, methinks.

604
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,776
What if this plan fails, Master?

605
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:24,613
We could be stuck here a very long time.

606
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,239
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help,

607
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,786
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

608
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:32,872
And...

609
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:35,827
there's something about this boy.

610
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,013
You should be very proud of your son.

611
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:47,143
He gives without any thought of reward.

612
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,101
Well, he knows nothing of greed.

613
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:54,194
He has a—
He has special powers.

614
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,193
Yes.

615
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,983
He can see things before they happen.

616
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,897
That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes.

617
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,857
It's a Jedi trait.

618
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:07,819
He deserves better than a slave's life.
Why, certainly.

619
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:11,289
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

620
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,334
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

621
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:19,378
Who was his father?

622
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,968
There was no father.

623
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:28,756
I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him.

624
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:32,136
I can't explain what happened.

625
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,599
Can you help him?

626
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,646
I don't know.

627
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:43,777
I didn't actually come here to free slaves.

628
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,870
Hey, hi, Ani.

629
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:55,464
Hi.

630
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,791
Wow, a real astro droid.

631
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:04,378
How did you get so lucky?
That isn't the half of it.

632
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:07,507
I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
What?

633
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,343
With this?

634
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:12,218
You're such a joker, Ani.

635
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:15,598
You've been working
on that thing for years.
It's never gonna run.

636
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:17,885
Come on. Let's go and play ball.

637
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:21,269
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

638
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,660
Hey,JarJar.

639
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:32,202
Keep away from those energy binders.

640
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:35,785
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

641
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,961
Sorry. Okay.

642
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,547
My tongue is fat.

643
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,799
My tongue— Wrench.

644
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,552
Where is da wrench? Oh, dare it is.

645
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,255
Hey. Uh-oh.

646
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:55,556
Uh, Ani, I'm stuck. Ani—

647
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:59,691
You know, I find thatJarJar creature
to be a little odd.

648
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:04,402
You don't even know if this thing's gonna run.

649
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,613
It will.
I think it's time we found out.

650
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:08,954
Here, use this power charge.
Yes, sir!

651
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,110
Come on, Kitster. Let's move away.

652
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,408
My— My mouth.

653
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:17,162
Ani, I'm stuck.

654
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:22,288
Uh, hey. My tongue is fat. Ani!

655
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:25,376
You're quite right. He's very odd indeed.

656
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:29,132
Oh. Th— Thank you.

657
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,126
Go.

658
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:49,278
It's working! It's working!

659
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:02,424
Stay still, Ani. Let me clean this cut.

660
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,500
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

661
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,457
Most of them.

662
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,587
Has anyone been to 'em all?

663
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,514
Not likely.

664
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:16,684
I wanna be the first one to see 'em all.

665
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,433
Ani, bedtime!
Ow!

666
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:23,268
There we are. Good as new.

667
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:26,234
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

668
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:29,857
What are you doing?
Checking your blood for infections.

669
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:33,614
Go on. You have a big day tomorrow.

670
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,617
Sleep well, Ani.

671
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:40,367
Obi-Wan?
Yes, Master?

672
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,124
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

673
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:46,579
Wait a minute.

674
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,669
I need a midi-chlorian count.

675
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:54,302
The reading is off the chart.

676
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,255
Over 20,000.

677
00:50:56,345 --> 00:51:00,055
Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.

678
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:01,931
No Jedi has.

679
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,097
What does that mean?

680
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,146
I'm not sure.

681
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:19,469
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

682
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:23,313
Patience, my blue friend.
You'll have your winnings before the suns set.

683
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,640
And we'll be far away from here.

684
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:29,306
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

685
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:33,266
I warn you, no funny business.

686
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,530
You don't think Anakin can win?
Don't get me wrong, no.

687
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:39,162
I have great faith in the boy.

688
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,410
He's a credit to your race,

689
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:44,742
but, uh, Sebulba there is going to win, I think.

690
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,580
Oh, no!

691
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,591
Why do you think that?

692
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:58,512
He always wins!

693
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,092
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

694
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:06,218
- I'll take that bet.
- You what?

695
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:09,728
I'll wager my new racing pod against, say,

696
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,732
the boy and his mother.

697
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:15,534
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

698
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,189
The boy, then.

699
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:20,989
Hmm. Well, uh—

700
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,950
We'll let fate decide, huh?

701
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:30,497
I just happen to have a chance cube here.

702
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:33,673
Blue, it's the boy.

703
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:37,962
Red, uh... his mother.

704
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:52,311
You won this small toss, outlander,
but you won't win the race!

705
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,516
So it makes little difference!

706
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:09,245
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

707
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,540
What'd he mean by that?
I'll tell you later.

708
00:54:15,628 --> 00:54:17,708
Good morning.

709
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,796
Oh, my.

710
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,882
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

711
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:27,967
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

712
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:31,477
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

713
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:35,860
- Do what?
- Finish the race, of course.

714
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:40,569
- You've never won a race?
- Well, not exactly.

715
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:42,703
Not even finished?

716
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,320
Kitster's right. I will this time.

717
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,487
Of course you will.

718
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,983
...Pod-racers.

719
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:18,984
That's absolutely right.

720
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:24,146
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

721
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:27,868
I see the contestants are making their way
out onto the starting grid.

722
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:32,832
I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund System.

723
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,920
Two-time winner Boles Roor.

724
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:46,094
Sebulba!

725
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:58,774
And in the front row, nearside pole position,

726
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:00,936
Mawhonic!

727
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:04,149
A hearty hello...

728
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:08,026
to Clegg Holdfast and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!

729
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,865
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

730
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:14,041
And back again, it's the mighty Dud Bolt...

731
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:18,751
with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.

732
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:24,384
And hoping for a big win today,

733
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:28,885
Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.

734
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:37,064
And a late entry, young Anakin Skywalker,

735
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:39,654
a local boy.

736
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,436
I see the flags are moving out onto the track.

737
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:55,912
Huh?

738
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:00,539
Pee yousa!

739
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,173
Be safe.

740
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,665
I will, Mom. I promise.

741
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,018
Uh-oh.

742
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,484
You won't walk away from this one...

743
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,858
you slave scum.

744
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:32,236
Don't count on it, slime ball.

745
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:34,584
You're bantha fodder!

746
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:41,543
You all set, Ani?
Yep.

747
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,535
Right.
Whoa!

748
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:50,045
Remember, concentrate on the moment.

749
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:53,933
Feel, don't think. Use your instincts.

750
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,682
I will.

751
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:58,024
May the Force be with you.

752
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:09,992
Jabba the Hutt.

753
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,906
Mmm.

754
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:22,826
Welcome.

755
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:27,455
Begin the race!

756
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,558
Hey, it looks like they're clearing the grid.

757
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,648
Is he nervous?
He's fine.

758
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:49,151
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not—

759
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:52,154
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

760
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,157
You should too.

761
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,699
You assume too much.

762
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,873
Start your engines.

763
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:42,497
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

764
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,376
Oh!

765
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:05,144
Oh, no! No!

766
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:12,728
Wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.

767
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:27,421
Well, it looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.

768
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:31,499
- Come on, Ani!
- [ Engine Clicking, Whirring ]

769
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:39,887
And there goes Skywalker!
- Go, Ani, go!

770
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,180
He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.

771
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:47,892
- Ehh!

772
01:00:54,026 --> 01:00:56,276
Haaaa!

773
01:01:55,754 --> 01:02:00,594
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out on the canyon dune turn.

774
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:10,524
Doowat macroon!

775
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:16,523
Ooh, there goes Quadinaros' power coupling.

776
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:20,113
Cheespa wata!

777
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:21,815
Ooh!

778
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:25,825
- Chubba ni chees Sebulba!
- Paketa!

779
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,619
Kulkah meeka!

780
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:32,368
Ody Mandrell coona wa wunda dungo!

781
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:40,804
Whoa!

782
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:46,429
Oh, no!

783
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:49,385
Oh.

784
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:54,346
Where is Master Anakin?

785
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:58,646
Look. Here he comes.

786
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:03,822
It looks like Skywalker is moving up in the field.

787
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:06,155
Yay! Yippee!

788
01:03:12,164 --> 01:03:15,174
- He has to complete two more circuits?

789
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,210
Oh, dear.

790
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,432
Ah.

791
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,932
Ha!

792
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:17,312
Arrr!

793
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:26,648
Skywalker's spinning out of control!

794
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:28,547
Oh, I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

795
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:37,347
Here he comes! Owoo!

796
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:40,604
At the start of the final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead,

797
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:43,187
followed closely by Skywalker!

798
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:44,863
Go, Ani!

799
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:13,551
- Skywalker's been forced onto the service ramp!

800
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:20,682
Whoa-oa!

801
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:32,400
- Huh?

802
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:38,911
- It's Skywalker!
- Sebulba!

803
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:43,325
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

804
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,206
Did he crash-ed?

805
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,971
- Wah hota!

806
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:29,336
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

807
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:25,017
He's catching Sebulba!
Inkabunga!

808
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,691
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

809
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:31,150
Wha— Chuba da noya!

810
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:01,347
That little human being is out of his mind.
Punda tah punda!

811
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:04,061
They're side by side!
Bangu du bangu!

812
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:13,402
Wa-waaaaah!

813
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:22,775
Aaah!

814
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,913
Poo doo!

815
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:33,212
Yippee!
Yay!

816
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:35,924
Ya eeka buta! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

817
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:39,165
- I can't believe it.

818
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:41,179
The crowds are going nuts!

819
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:43,431
Oh! Ah! Oh! Ah!

820
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:49,978
Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Ah!

821
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:52,151
Yay, Ani!

822
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,529
Mom, I did it! Yeah!

823
01:10:03,992 --> 01:10:05,952
Ohh!

824
01:10:06,995 --> 01:10:08,905
Good going, Ani!

825
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,251
We owe you everything, Ani.

826
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:17,746
Mmm!
aww.

827
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:20,009
It's so wonderful, Ani.

828
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:22,841
You have brought hope to those who have none.

829
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:25,177
I'm so very proud of you.

830
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:29,175
aww.

831
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:31,687
Oy chuba no.

832
01:10:35,607 --> 01:10:37,517
You.

833
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:39,939
You swindled me!

834
01:10:40,028 --> 01:10:43,908
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.

835
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,910
I lost everything.

836
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:48,912
Whenever you gamble,
my friend, eventually you'll lose.

837
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:51,905
Bring the parts to the main hangar.

838
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:55,328
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.

839
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:58,798
You can't have him. It wasn't a fair bet.

840
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:04,427
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?

841
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,600
I'm sure they can settle this.

842
01:11:09,057 --> 01:11:11,017
Take him.

843
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:19,819
Hidoe!

844
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:22,821
Well, we have
all the essential parts we need.

845
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:26,074
I'm going back.
Some unfinished business. I won't be long.

846
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:29,657
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

847
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:33,624
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

848
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:35,616
Get this hyperdrive generator installed.

849
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,288
Yes, Master. That shouldn't take long.

850
01:11:38,378 --> 01:11:40,548
Come on. Hup!

851
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:48,304
Hey. These are yours.

852
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:50,348
Yes!

853
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:53,678
Mom, we sold the pod!

854
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:56,190
Look at all the money we have!
My goodness!

855
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:59,232
But that's so wonderful, Ani.
And he has been freed.

856
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:02,105
- What?
- You're no longer a slave.

857
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,946
Did you hear that?

858
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:09,200
Now you can make your dreams come true, Ani.

859
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:12,043
You are free.

860
01:12:15,123 --> 01:12:17,043
Will you take him with you?

861
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:19,455
Is he to become a Jedi?
Yes.

862
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:21,464
Our meeting was not a coincidence.

863
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:24,006
Nothing happens by accident.

864
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:27,680
You mean I get to come with you in your starship?

865
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,680
Anakin,

866
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:34,385
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge,

867
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:37,385
and even if you succeed, it's a hard life.

868
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:40,688
But I wanna go.
It's what I've always dreamed of doing.

869
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:43,653
Can I go, Mom?

870
01:12:43,735 --> 01:12:45,985
Anakin,

871
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:49,320
this path has been placed before you.

872
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,947
The choice is yours alone.

873
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:57,458
I wanna do it.

874
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,250
Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.

875
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:03,455
Yippee!

876
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:10,471
What about Mom?

877
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,466
Is she free too?

878
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:19,098
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

879
01:13:19,187 --> 01:13:22,147
You're coming with us, aren't you, Mom?

880
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:33,449
Son, my place is here. My future is here.

881
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:36,954
It is time for you to let go.

882
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:39,248
I don't want things to change.

883
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:41,752
But you can't stop the change...

884
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:44,924
any more than you can stop the suns from setting.

885
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:47,915
Oh, I love you.

886
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,514
Now hurry.

887
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,440
Thank you.

888
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:05,442
I'll watch after him. You have my word.

889
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:10,111
Will you be all right?

890
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:12,156
Yeah.

891
01:14:14,325 --> 01:14:16,785
Oh! Oh, my. Oh!

892
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,789
Hello, Master Anakin.

893
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,961
Well, 3PO, I've been freed...

894
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,460
and I'm going away in a starship.

895
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:26,503
Master Anakin,
you are my maker and I wish you well.

896
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:30,837
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.

897
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:36,295
I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you, 3PO,
give you coverings and all.

898
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:40,349
I'm gonna miss working on you.
You've been a great pal.

899
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:43,354
I'll make sure
Mom doesn't sell you or anything.

900
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:45,187
Sell me?

901
01:14:45,273 --> 01:14:46,943
Bye.

902
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:48,944
Oh, my.

903
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:15,303
I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.

904
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:18,096
Ani.

905
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,600
Will I ever see you again?

906
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:25,939
What does your heart tell you?

907
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,523
I hope so.

908
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:31,529
Yes.

909
01:15:31,611 --> 01:15:33,531
I guess.

910
01:15:33,613 --> 01:15:36,533
Then we will see each other again.

911
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,445
I will come back and free you, Mom.

912
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,498
I promise.

913
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:55,720
Now, be brave...

914
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:58,511
and don't look back.

915
01:15:58,596 --> 01:16:00,506
Don't look back.

916
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:48,726
- Qui-Gon, sir, wait! I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!

917
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:54,150
Go! Tell them to take off!

918
01:17:07,707 --> 01:17:09,617
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

919
01:17:09,709 --> 01:17:11,419
Take off.

920
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:14,343
Over there. Fly low.

921
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:37,154
Are you all right?

922
01:17:37,236 --> 01:17:39,146
I think so.

923
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:41,158
What was it?

924
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:44,660
I'm not sure,
but it was well-trained in the Jedi arts.

925
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:47,754
My guess is it was after the queen.

926
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:50,370
What are we gonna do about it?

927
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:54,213
We shall be patient.

928
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:57,125
Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

929
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:59,424
- Hi.

930
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:03,258
You're a Jedi too? Pleased to meet you.

931
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:13,346
Your queen is lost, your people are starving,

932
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:15,359
and you, Governor, are going to die...

933
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:18,361
much sooner than your people, I'm afraid.

934
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:20,614
This invasion will gain you nothing.

935
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:23,736
We're a democracy. The people have decided.

936
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:25,784
Take him away.

937
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:32,083
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

938
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:34,576
for these rumored underwater villages.

939
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:37,128
They will not stay hidden for long.

940
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,890
The death toll is catastrophic.

941
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:53,596
We must bow to their wishes.

942
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:55,977
You must contact me.

943
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:11,997
You all right?

944
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:14,791
It's very cold.

945
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:25,678
You come from a warm planet, Ani.

946
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:28,181
A little too warm for my taste.

947
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:30,564
Space is cold.

948
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:32,851
You seem sad.

949
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:36,266
The queen is worried.

950
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:38,725
Her people are suffering, dying.

951
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:42,396
She must convince the senate to intervene, or...

952
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:46,203
I'm not sure what'll happen.

953
01:19:47,575 --> 01:19:49,695
I made this for you...

954
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,040
so you'd remember me.

955
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:56,462
I carved it out of a japor snippet.

956
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:59,382
It'll bring you good fortune.

957
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,381
It's beautiful.

958
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,883
But I don't need this to remember you by.

959
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:10,931
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani,

960
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:13,595
but my caring for you will remain.

961
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:19,480
I care for you, too, only I—

962
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:21,725
Miss your mother.

963
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:44,379
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

964
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:46,255
There's ChancellorValorum's shuttle.

965
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:49,642
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

966
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:22,166
It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty.

967
01:21:22,253 --> 01:21:25,093
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

968
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:27,882
I'm anxious to hear your report on the situation.

969
01:21:27,967 --> 01:21:30,587
May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

970
01:21:30,678 --> 01:21:34,848
Welcome, Your Highness.
It's an honor to finally meet you in person.

971
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:37,562
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

972
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:40,813
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

973
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,646
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.

974
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:47,653
I'm grateful for your concern, Chancellor.

975
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:49,646
There is a question of procedure,

976
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:52,488
but I'm confident we can overcome it.

977
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:55,494
I must speak with the Jedi Council immediately.

978
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:58,447
The situation has become much more complicated.

979
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:06,129
Ani, come on.

980
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:20,018
The queen's a bein' grossly nice, mesa tinks.

981
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:23,353
Pitty hot.

982
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:55,505
There is no civility, only politics.

983
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:59,516
The Republic is not what it once was.

984
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:04,900
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

985
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,900
There is no interest...

986
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,112
in the common good.

987
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:11,443
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

988
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:14,448
There is little chance
the senate will act on the invasion.

989
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:17,451
ChancellorValorum
seems to think there is hope.

990
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:21,664
If I may say so, Your Majesty,
the chancellor has little real power.

991
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:25,627
He is mired by baseless accusations of corruption.

992
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:29,501
The bureaucrats are in charge now.
What options have we?

993
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:33,168
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

994
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:35,178
of a stronger supreme chancellor,

995
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,760
one who could control the bureaucrats...

996
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,716
and give us justice.

997
01:23:39,807 --> 01:23:44,097
You could call for a vote of no confidence...

998
01:23:44,186 --> 01:23:46,096
in Chancellor Valorum.

999
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:48,728
He has been our strongest supporter.

1000
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:54,066
Our only other choice
would be to submit a plea to the courts.

1001
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:57,534
The courts take even longer to decide things
than the senate.

1002
01:23:57,616 --> 01:24:00,536
Our people are dying, Senator.

1003
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:04,369
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

1004
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:07,076
To be realistic, Your Majesty,

1005
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:12,257
I think we're going to have to accept
Federation control for the time being.

1006
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,046
That is something I cannot do.

1007
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:25,980
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

1008
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:30,021
My only conclusion can be that it was a Sith lord.

1009
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:34,317
Impossible.
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.

1010
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:38,613
I do not believe the Sith
could have returned without us knowing.

1011
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:41,829
Ah, hard to see, the dark side is.

1012
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,830
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

1013
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,963
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

1014
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:50,001
May the Force be with you.

1015
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:55,465
Master Qui-Gon.

1016
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:58,009
More to say have you?

1017
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,180
With your permission, my master,

1018
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:06,680
I have encountered a vergence in the Force.

1019
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:09,809
A vergence, you say?

1020
01:25:09,897 --> 01:25:12,057
Located around a person?

1021
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:14,069
A boy.

1022
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:17,991
His cells have the highest concentration
of midi-chlorians I have seen in a life-form.

1023
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:21,031
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

1024
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:25,039
You refer to the prophecy...

1025
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,540
of the one who will bring balance to the Force.

1026
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:29,463
You believe it's this boy?

1027
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:32,213
I don't presume to--
But you do.

1028
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:34,964
Revealed your opinion is.

1029
01:25:35,047 --> 01:25:37,087
I request the boy be tested, Master.

1030
01:25:37,174 --> 01:25:42,434
Oh? Trained as a Jedi you request for him, hmm?

1031
01:25:42,513 --> 01:25:45,313
Finding him was the will of the Force.

1032
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,350
I have no doubt of that.

1033
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:56,072
Bring him before us, then.

1034
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:08,998
The boy's here to see Padmé.

1035
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:11,041
Let him in.

1036
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:17,839
I'm sorry, Ani,
but Padmé's not here right now.

1037
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:20,263
Who is it?

1038
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:23,392
Anakin Skywalker to see Padmé,
Your Highness.

1039
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:25,390
I've sent Padmé on an errand.

1040
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:30,392
I'm on my way to the Jedi temple
to start my training, I hope.

1041
01:26:30,477 --> 01:26:34,357
I may never see her again,
so I came to say good-bye.

1042
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,359
We will tell her for you.

1043
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:39,071
We are sure her heart goes with you.

1044
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:41,282
Thank you, Your Highness.

1045
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:59,340
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1046
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:10,516
Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the senate,

1047
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:13,021
a tragedy has occurred...

1048
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:16,653
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

1049
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:19,782
and has now engulfed our entire planet...

1050
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,900
in the oppression of the Trade Federation.

1051
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:24,237
This is outrageous!

1052
01:27:24,323 --> 01:27:26,913
I object to the senator's statements.

1053
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:31,082
The chair does not recognize
the senator from the Trade Federation at this time.

1054
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:35,083
To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala,

1055
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:37,167
recently elected ruler of the Naboo,

1056
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,172
who speaks on our behalf.

1057
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:47,927
Honorable representatives of the Republic,

1058
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:51,143
I come to you
under the gravest of circumstances.

1059
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:54,274
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade—

1060
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:57,813
I object! There is no proof!

1061
01:27:57,898 --> 01:27:59,818
This is incredible.

1062
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:03,990
We recommend a commission be sent to Naboo
to ascertain the truth.

1063
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:06,321
The Congress of Malastare concurs...

1064
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:09,236
with the honorable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1065
01:28:09,326 --> 01:28:11,736
A commission must be appointed.
The point—

1066
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:14,998
Excuse me, Chancellor.
Enter the bureaucrat.

1067
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:17,792
The true rulers of the Republic.

1068
01:28:17,876 --> 01:28:22,046
And on the payroll of the Trade Federation,
I might add.

1069
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:26,380
This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength
will disappear.

1070
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:30,298
The point is conceded.

1071
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:33,309
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...

1072
01:28:33,392 --> 01:28:35,942
to explore the validity of your accusations?

1073
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:37,939
I will not defer.

1074
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:41,571
I've come before you to resolve this attack
on our sovereignty now.

1075
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:44,690
I was not elected
to watch my people suffer and die...

1076
01:28:44,778 --> 01:28:47,528
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1077
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:52,831
If this body is not capable of action,

1078
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:55,961
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1079
01:28:57,708 --> 01:29:00,578
I move for a vote of no confidence...

1080
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:02,669
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1081
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:14,811
Vote now! Vote now!

1082
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:17,693
Vote now! Vote now!
Order!

1083
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:20,689
Now they will elect a new chancellor,

1084
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:22,692
a strong chancellor,

1085
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:25,694
one who will not let our tragedy continue.

1086
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:31,702
The boy will not pass the council's test, Master.
He's too old.

1087
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:34,743
Anakin will become a Jedi, I promise you.

1088
01:29:34,828 --> 01:29:37,748
Do not defy the council, Master,
not again.

1089
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:40,621
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1090
01:29:42,461 --> 01:29:46,261
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1091
01:29:46,339 --> 01:29:49,509
They will not
go along with you this time.

1092
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:52,513
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1093
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:57,177
A ship.

1094
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,770
A cup.

1095
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:02,694
A ship.

1096
01:30:03,774 --> 01:30:06,324
A speeder.

1097
01:30:08,278 --> 01:30:10,198
Hmm.

1098
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:14,744
How feel you?

1099
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:16,736
Cold, sir.

1100
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:19,874
Afraid are you?

1101
01:30:19,956 --> 01:30:21,916
No, sir.

1102
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,630
See through you we can.

1103
01:30:24,711 --> 01:30:26,631
Be mindful of your feelings.

1104
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:29,513
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1105
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:33,716
I miss her.
Mmm.

1106
01:30:33,804 --> 01:30:36,314
Afraid to lose her, I think, mmm?

1107
01:30:36,389 --> 01:30:38,599
What has that got to do with anything?

1108
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:41,023
Everything.

1109
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:44,192
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1110
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:47,192
Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate.

1111
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:50,685
Hate leads to suffering.

1112
01:30:57,202 --> 01:31:00,122
I sense much fear in you.

1113
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:16,429
Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?

1114
01:31:16,513 --> 01:31:18,433
I don't know.

1115
01:31:18,515 --> 01:31:21,095
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1116
01:31:22,853 --> 01:31:25,603
I hope not.

1117
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:28,319
Gungans no dyin' without a fight.

1118
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,320
Wesa warriors.

1119
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:33,822
Wesa got a grand army.

1120
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:37,315
Dat's why you no liken us,
mesa tinks.

1121
01:31:37,409 --> 01:31:40,289
Your Highness?

1122
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:43,583
Your Highness.

1123
01:31:43,665 --> 01:31:46,825
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

1124
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:48,998
as supreme chancellor.

1125
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:52,007
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.

1126
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:56,800
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1127
01:31:56,887 --> 01:31:58,597
Who else has been nominated?

1128
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:03,020
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1129
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:08,061
I feel confident our situation
will create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1130
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:11,784
I will be chancellor.

1131
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,530
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats,

1132
01:32:14,613 --> 01:32:17,873
there'll be nothing left of our people,
our way of life.

1133
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:19,869
I understand your concern, Your Majesty.

1134
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:23,501
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1135
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:29,378
Senator, this is your arena.

1136
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:31,421
I feel I must return to mine.

1137
01:32:34,007 --> 01:32:36,927
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1138
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:39,010
Go back?
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.

1139
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:41,005
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1140
01:32:41,097 --> 01:32:43,517
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1141
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,140
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1142
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:48,147
Captain.
Your Highness.

1143
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:50,149
Ready my ship.

1144
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:53,941
Please, Your Majesty, stay here where it's safe.

1145
01:32:54,027 --> 01:32:57,237
It is clear to me now
that the Republic no longer functions.

1146
01:32:57,322 --> 01:33:01,662
I pray you will bring
sanity and compassion back to the senate.

1147
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:14,416
The Force is strong with him.

1148
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:16,466
He is to be trained, then?

1149
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:20,974
No, he will not be trained.

1150
01:33:21,054 --> 01:33:22,814
No?

1151
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:26,846
He is too old.

1152
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:30,765
He is the chosen one. You must see it.

1153
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:35,525
Mmm. Clouded this boy's future is.

1154
01:33:37,696 --> 01:33:39,526
I will train him, then.

1155
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:46,698
I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.

1156
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:49,788
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1157
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:52,254
Impossible to take on a second.

1158
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:53,995
The code forbids it.

1159
01:33:54,129 --> 01:33:57,549
Obi-Wan is ready.
I am ready to face the trials.

1160
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:01,302
Our own counsel we will keep on who is ready.

1161
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,296
He is headstrong,

1162
01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:06,768
and he has much to learn of the living Force,
but he is capable.

1163
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,890
There is little more he can learn from me.

1164
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:13,358
Young Skywalker's fate...

1165
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,320
will be decided later.

1166
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,990
Now is not the time for this.

1167
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:20,739
The senate is voting for a new supreme chancellor,

1168
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:23,532
and Queen Amidala is returning home,

1169
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:26,866
which will put pressure on the Federation and
could widen the confrontation.

1170
01:34:26,953 --> 01:34:29,293
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1171
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:33,792
Go with the queen to Naboo
and discover the identity of this dark warrior.

1172
01:34:35,045 --> 01:34:36,955
This is the clue we need...

1173
01:34:37,047 --> 01:34:39,337
to unravel the mystery of the Sith.

1174
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:42,264
May the Force be with you.

1175
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,360
It's not disrespect, Master. It's the truth.

1176
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:00,363
From your point of view.

1177
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:03,855
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1178
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:06,868
His fate is uncertain. He's not dangerous.

1179
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:09,371
The council will decide Anakin's future.

1180
01:35:09,454 --> 01:35:12,374
That should be enough for you. Now get on board.

1181
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:21,803
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1182
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:24,133
You won't be, Ani.

1183
01:35:24,219 --> 01:35:28,349
I'm not allowed to train you,
so I want you to watch me and be mindful.

1184
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:31,351
Always remember:

1185
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:34,104
Your focus determines your reality.

1186
01:35:34,187 --> 01:35:37,397
Stay close to me and you'll be safe.

1187
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:39,322
Master, sir,

1188
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:43,030
I heard Yoda talking about midi-chlorians.

1189
01:35:43,113 --> 01:35:46,663
I've been wondering— What are midi-chlorians?

1190
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:50,329
Midi-chlorians are a microscopic life-form...

1191
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:52,701
that resides within all living cells.

1192
01:35:54,124 --> 01:35:57,004
They live inside me?
Inside your cells, yes.

1193
01:35:57,127 --> 01:36:00,627
And we are symbionts with them.
Symbionts?

1194
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:04,633
Life-forms living together for mutual advantage.

1195
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:07,637
Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist...

1196
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:10,560
and we would have no knowledge of the Force.

1197
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,560
They continually speak to us,

1198
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:15,352
telling us the will of the Force.

1199
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,596
When you learn to quiet your mind,

1200
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:19,609
you'll hear them speaking to you.

1201
01:36:19,691 --> 01:36:21,611
I don't understand.

1202
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:25,203
With time and training, Ani, you will. You will.

1203
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:33,293
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure to continue
to serve and protect you.

1204
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:35,291
I welcome your help.

1205
01:36:35,373 --> 01:36:38,793
Senator Palpatine fears
that the Federation means to destroy me.

1206
01:36:38,877 --> 01:36:42,087
I assure you I will not allow that to happen.

1207
01:36:42,172 --> 01:36:45,092
Wesa goin' ho-o-o-me!

1208
01:36:45,175 --> 01:36:48,085
Come on, R2.

1209
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:59,734
Is the planet secure?

1210
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:03,734
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1211
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:06,948
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1212
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:12,910
Good. I will see to it that in the senate
things stay as they are.

1213
01:37:12,994 --> 01:37:16,914
I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.

1214
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:18,918
Yes, my lord.

1215
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,920
A Sith here?

1216
01:37:26,299 --> 01:37:28,799
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1217
01:37:28,885 --> 01:37:31,295
And those two control the pitch?

1218
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:34,767
You catch on pretty quick.

1219
01:37:34,849 --> 01:37:36,769
As soon as we land,

1220
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:39,601
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1221
01:37:39,687 --> 01:37:43,437
I agree. I'm not sure
what you wish to accomplish by this.

1222
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:46,444
I will take back what's ours.

1223
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:48,987
There are too few of us, Your Highness.

1224
01:37:49,072 --> 01:37:50,992
We have no army.

1225
01:37:51,074 --> 01:37:54,664
And I can only protect you.
I can't fight a war for you.

1226
01:37:54,744 --> 01:37:56,754
JarJar Binks.

1227
01:37:56,829 --> 01:37:59,869
Mesa, Your Highness?

1228
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:02,878
Yes. I need your help.

1229
01:38:08,091 --> 01:38:10,341
I have one battleship on my scope.

1230
01:38:10,426 --> 01:38:12,546
It's a droid control ship.

1231
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:14,547
They've probably spotted us.

1232
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:16,679
We haven't much time.

1233
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:32,072
JarJar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.
Good.

1234
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:35,076
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?

1235
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:38,079
The Gungans will not be easily swayed.

1236
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:41,042
And we cannot use our power to help her.

1237
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:45,922
I'm— I'm sorry for my behavior, Master.

1238
01:38:46,004 --> 01:38:49,804
It's not my place
to disagree with you about the boy.

1239
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:55,006
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1240
01:38:56,097 --> 01:38:58,017
You've been a good apprentice, Obi-Wan.

1241
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:02,354
And you're a much wiser man than I am.

1242
01:39:02,437 --> 01:39:06,187
I foresee you will become a great Jedi knight.

1243
01:39:19,162 --> 01:39:21,582
Desa nobody dare.

1244
01:39:21,664 --> 01:39:23,874
The Gungan city is deserted.

1245
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:26,538
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1246
01:39:26,627 --> 01:39:29,757
Do you think they have been
taken to the camps?

1247
01:39:29,839 --> 01:39:32,169
More likely they were wiped out.

1248
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:35,390
Mesa no tink so.
Do you know where they are,JarJar?

1249
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:38,930
When in trouble, Gungans go to sacred place.

1250
01:39:39,015 --> 01:39:41,925
Mesa show you. Come on. Mesa show you!

1251
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:03,912
Your Honor, Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1252
01:40:09,087 --> 01:40:13,877
Uh, h-heyo dadee,
Big Boss Nass, Your Honor.

1253
01:40:13,966 --> 01:40:17,086
JarJar Binks.

1254
01:40:17,178 --> 01:40:21,348
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1255
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:23,732
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1256
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:26,980
I come before you in peace.

1257
01:40:27,063 --> 01:40:29,943
Ah, Naboo biggen.

1258
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:33,244
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1259
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:37,069
Yousa all bombad.

1260
01:40:37,156 --> 01:40:40,776
We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.

1261
01:40:40,868 --> 01:40:42,788
Your Honor.

1262
01:40:44,455 --> 01:40:47,365
Whosa dis?

1263
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:50,420
I am Queen Amidala.
Huh?

1264
01:40:51,379 --> 01:40:53,299
This is my decoy,

1265
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:56,761
my protection, my loyal bodyguard.

1266
01:40:56,843 --> 01:41:01,183
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1267
01:41:01,264 --> 01:41:04,184
Although we do not always agree, Your Honor,

1268
01:41:04,267 --> 01:41:07,187
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1269
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:09,190
- Ah.
- The Trade Federation...

1270
01:41:09,272 --> 01:41:11,482
has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1271
01:41:11,566 --> 01:41:14,896
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1272
01:41:14,986 --> 01:41:17,236
I ask you to help us.

1273
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:20,071
No, I beg you to help us.

1274
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:22,528
We are your humble servants.

1275
01:41:24,996 --> 01:41:28,576
Our fate is in your hands.

1276
01:41:28,666 --> 01:41:31,166
Mmm.

1277
01:41:39,552 --> 01:41:42,512
Ha!

1278
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:50,056
Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans?

1279
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:56,443
Me-e-esa lika dis!

1280
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:58,357
Maybe...

1281
01:41:58,446 --> 01:42:01,026
wesa...

1282
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:03,025
bein friends.

1283
01:42:08,206 --> 01:42:11,116
Yippee! Ya-hoo!

1284
01:42:11,209 --> 01:42:13,539
We've sent our patrols.

1285
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:17,128
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1286
01:42:17,215 --> 01:42:19,415
It won't be long, my lord.

1287
01:42:19,509 --> 01:42:22,679
This is an unexpected move for her.

1288
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:24,802
It's too aggressive.

1289
01:42:24,889 --> 01:42:27,349
Lord Maul, be mindful.

1290
01:42:27,433 --> 01:42:30,023
Let them make the first move.

1291
01:42:30,102 --> 01:42:32,062
Yes, my master.

1292
01:42:35,525 --> 01:42:37,225
Deysa comin!

1293
01:42:37,318 --> 01:42:39,738
All right!

1294
01:42:41,572 --> 01:42:43,492
They're here!

1295
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:45,534
Good. They made it.

1296
01:42:50,039 --> 01:42:51,919
Yousa doen grand.

1297
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:55,961
JarJar bring uss-en
and da Naboo together.

1298
01:42:56,045 --> 01:42:57,955
Ah, no, no, no.

1299
01:42:58,047 --> 01:43:01,047
So, wesa make you...

1300
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:03,183
bombad general.

1301
01:43:03,261 --> 01:43:05,681
General?

1302
01:43:07,765 --> 01:43:09,765
Captain.

1303
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:12,520
Your Highness.
What is the situation?

1304
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:14,523
Almost everyone's in camps.

1305
01:43:14,605 --> 01:43:17,855
A few hundred police and guards
have formed an underground resistance movement.

1306
01:43:17,942 --> 01:43:20,532
I brought back
as many of the leaders as I could.

1307
01:43:20,611 --> 01:43:25,281
The Federation army's also
much larger than we thought, and much stronger.

1308
01:43:25,366 --> 01:43:29,696
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1309
01:43:29,787 --> 01:43:31,707
The battle is a diversion.

1310
01:43:31,789 --> 01:43:34,999
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1311
01:43:35,084 --> 01:43:37,674
R2.

1312
01:43:37,753 --> 01:43:41,383
We can enter the city using the secret passages
on the waterfall side.

1313
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:43,375
Once we get to the main entrance,

1314
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:46,297
Captain Panaka will create a diversion.

1315
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:49,347
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1316
01:43:49,432 --> 01:43:52,732
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1317
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:54,730
What do you think, Master Jedi?

1318
01:43:54,812 --> 01:43:56,982
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1319
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:59,484
The difficulty is getting into the throne room.

1320
01:43:59,567 --> 01:44:02,027
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1321
01:44:02,111 --> 01:44:06,871
There is a possibility, with this diversion,
many Gungans will be killed.

1322
01:44:06,949 --> 01:44:10,289
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1323
01:44:10,369 --> 01:44:13,579
We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.

1324
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:15,584
We will send what pilots we have...

1325
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:18,706
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1326
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:21,924
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1327
01:44:22,006 --> 01:44:24,916
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1328
01:44:25,009 --> 01:44:26,929
There's an even bigger danger.

1329
01:44:27,011 --> 01:44:28,931
If the viceroy escapes, Your Highness,

1330
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:31,263
he will return with another droid army.

1331
01:44:31,349 --> 01:44:34,599
Well, that is why we must not
fail to get the viceroy.

1332
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:36,595
Everything depends on it.

1333
01:44:42,026 --> 01:44:44,606
She is more foolish than I thought.

1334
01:44:44,695 --> 01:44:49,655
We are sending all troops to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.

1335
01:44:49,742 --> 01:44:52,452
It appears to be made up of primitives.

1336
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:55,116
This will work to our advantage.

1337
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:57,996
I have your approval to proceed, then, my lord?

1338
01:44:58,084 --> 01:45:00,544
Wipe them out.

1339
01:45:02,213 --> 01:45:04,173
All of them.

1340
01:45:34,954 --> 01:45:36,914
Halt!

1341
01:45:39,792 --> 01:45:42,092
Starting up the shield.

1342
01:46:11,282 --> 01:46:12,822
Open fire.

1343
01:46:28,257 --> 01:46:32,177
Once we get inside,
you find a safe place to hide and stay there.

1344
01:46:32,303 --> 01:46:34,223
Sure.
Stay there.

1345
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:52,284
Roger. Roger.

1346
01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:03,367
I thought the battle
was going to take place far from here.

1347
01:47:03,459 --> 01:47:05,999
This is too close.

1348
01:47:11,091 --> 01:47:12,631
Ani, find cover.

1349
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:16,718
Quick!
Get to your ships!

1350
01:47:28,984 --> 01:47:30,864
Aah!

1351
01:47:43,082 --> 01:47:45,042
Aah!

1352
01:48:15,447 --> 01:48:17,867
- Fighters straight ahead.
- Roger, Bravo Leader.

1353
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:19,240
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1354
01:48:27,084 --> 01:48:28,964
Cease fire.

1355
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:38,970
Steady. Steady.

1356
01:49:12,046 --> 01:49:15,296
Activate the droids.
Yes, sir.

1357
01:49:31,815 --> 01:49:33,685
Ouch time.

1358
01:49:47,790 --> 01:49:50,170
Fire!

1359
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:52,460
Whoa-ohh!

1360
01:50:02,846 --> 01:50:05,136
Aah! Whoa!

1361
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:13,019
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1362
01:50:13,107 --> 01:50:16,527
Red group! Blue group! Everybody, this way!

1363
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:18,650
Hey, wait for me!

1364
01:50:18,737 --> 01:50:21,157
Stay where you are. You'll be safe there.

1365
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:23,700
- But I—
- Stay in that cockpit.

1366
01:50:35,421 --> 01:50:38,721
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1367
01:50:58,861 --> 01:51:00,861
We gotta do something, R2.

1368
01:51:23,594 --> 01:51:26,604
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1369
01:51:29,933 --> 01:51:33,103
Oops, wrong one. Maybe it's this one.

1370
01:51:33,187 --> 01:51:36,607
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1371
01:51:37,775 --> 01:51:40,275
Yeah!

1372
01:51:45,115 --> 01:51:47,615
Let's go!

1373
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:49,951
It's on automatic pilot.

1374
01:51:59,004 --> 01:52:02,424
Try to override it.

1375
01:53:00,399 --> 01:53:02,899
We don't have time for this, Captain.

1376
01:53:09,032 --> 01:53:10,912
Look! There they are.

1377
01:53:10,993 --> 01:53:13,373
That's where the autopilot's taking us.

1378
01:53:24,006 --> 01:53:27,086
Huh? Waaah! Aah! Aah!

1379
01:53:27,176 --> 01:53:29,136
Aah!

1380
01:53:29,219 --> 01:53:33,009
Aaah! Hmm!
Dumb droid. Take that!

1381
01:53:33,098 --> 01:53:36,348
Get off! Get off! Get off! Get off!

1382
01:53:36,435 --> 01:53:38,435
Ooh! Ooh! Mooie!

1383
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,900
Whoo-hoo! Aah!

1384
01:53:46,403 --> 01:53:48,783
The deflector shield is too strong.

1385
01:53:57,122 --> 01:53:59,462
- This is tense!

1386
01:54:00,834 --> 01:54:03,794
Whoa! R2, get us off this autopilot.

1387
01:54:03,879 --> 01:54:06,049
It's gonna get us both killed.

1388
01:54:06,131 --> 01:54:10,181
- You did it, R2!

1389
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:11,970
Okay, let's go left.

1390
01:54:15,057 --> 01:54:17,847
- Go back?

1391
01:54:17,935 --> 01:54:22,265
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1392
01:54:29,112 --> 01:54:31,572
I'll try spinning. That's a good trick.

1393
01:54:31,657 --> 01:54:33,657
Whoa!

1394
01:54:35,619 --> 01:54:39,789
- I know we're in trouble.Just hang on.

1395
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:48,670
Go!

1396
01:54:52,469 --> 01:54:54,259
Ascension guns!

1397
01:57:00,305 --> 01:57:01,965
Retreat! Retreat!

1398
01:57:03,725 --> 01:57:05,635
Dis is nutsen.

1399
01:57:05,727 --> 01:57:07,727
Hyah!

1400
01:57:08,939 --> 01:57:10,859
O-O-Ohh!

1401
01:57:15,487 --> 01:57:17,487
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

1402
01:57:17,572 --> 01:57:20,282
Ohh! Ohh!

1403
01:57:24,830 --> 01:57:27,040
Uh-oh! Aaah!

1404
01:57:35,715 --> 01:57:38,125
Hey! Hey!

1405
01:57:38,218 --> 01:57:41,848
Give me a lift! Aaah! Oh!

1406
01:57:42,973 --> 01:57:45,023
Aaah!

1407
01:57:46,143 --> 01:57:47,773
Ohh!

1408
01:57:47,853 --> 01:57:49,523
JarJar, usen da booma!

1409
01:57:49,604 --> 01:57:51,564
What? Mesa no have a booma!

1410
01:57:51,648 --> 01:57:53,608

1411
01:57:53,692 --> 01:57:56,822
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Aah!

1412
01:57:57,988 --> 01:57:59,608
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1413
01:57:59,698 --> 01:58:02,738
Whoa-ohh!

1414
01:58:02,826 --> 01:58:04,736
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1415
01:58:04,828 --> 01:58:06,368
Aaah!

1416
01:58:06,455 --> 01:58:08,705
Help me!

1417
01:58:09,833 --> 01:58:13,293
JarJar!Jump,JarJar,jump!

1418
01:58:22,929 --> 01:58:26,179
Put down your weapons. They win this round.

1419
01:58:39,070 --> 01:58:41,320
We're hit, R2! Aah!

1420
01:58:46,244 --> 01:58:48,584
Aaah!

1421
01:58:54,419 --> 01:58:57,509
I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop!

1422
01:59:04,638 --> 01:59:06,178
Everything's overheated.

1423
01:59:06,264 --> 01:59:09,684
- Oops. This is not good.

1424
01:59:55,188 --> 01:59:59,108
No!

1425
02:00:21,756 --> 02:00:24,296
No giben up, General JarJar.

1426
02:00:24,384 --> 02:00:26,264
Mesa tink of something.

1427
02:00:26,344 --> 02:00:28,804
- Hands up.
- My give up.

1428
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:30,810
My give up.

1429
02:00:39,482 --> 02:00:42,612
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

1430
02:00:42,694 --> 02:00:46,664
Time for you to sign the treaty
and end this pointless debate in the senate.

1431
02:00:46,740 --> 02:00:48,530
Viceroy!

1432
02:00:48,617 --> 02:00:50,617
Your occupation here has ended.

1433
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:55,500
After her. This one's a decoy.

1434
02:01:02,047 --> 02:01:04,667
Captain!

1435
02:01:12,223 --> 02:01:14,853
Jam the doors.

1436
02:01:17,646 --> 02:01:21,186
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

1437
02:02:23,461 --> 02:02:25,751
Yes! We have power.

1438
02:02:25,839 --> 02:02:28,379
Shields up.

1439
02:02:30,135 --> 02:02:31,885
Take this!

1440
02:02:33,221 --> 02:02:35,681
And this!

1441
02:02:35,765 --> 02:02:37,725
Whoa!

1442
02:02:42,188 --> 02:02:44,108
- Oops.
- We're losing power.

1443
02:02:44,232 --> 02:02:47,442
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.
Impossible!

1444
02:02:47,527 --> 02:02:49,447
Nothing can get through our shield.

1445
02:02:50,655 --> 02:02:53,445
- Let's get outta here.

1446
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:03,250
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1447
02:03:06,212 --> 02:03:07,802
We didn't hit it.

1448
02:03:10,884 --> 02:03:14,434
- Now, this is Pod-racing.

1449
02:03:14,512 --> 02:03:18,312
- Look, one of ours, out of the main hold!
- Whoo!

1450
02:03:22,687 --> 02:03:25,687
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
- Hee-hee!

1451
02:03:35,950 --> 02:03:39,120
What the—

1452
02:03:39,204 --> 02:03:41,504
Was'n they doing?

1453
02:03:41,581 --> 02:03:45,171
The control ship has been destroyed. Look!

1454
02:03:46,878 --> 02:03:49,248
They all broke-ed.

1455
02:04:37,637 --> 02:04:41,057
No, it-- it's too late.

1456
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:43,520
No.
Obi-Wan.

1457
02:04:44,727 --> 02:04:46,647
Promise—

1458
02:04:46,729 --> 02:04:48,979
Promise me you will train the boy.

1459
02:04:49,065 --> 02:04:51,015
Yes, Master.

1460
02:04:54,612 --> 02:04:57,662
He is the chosen one.

1461
02:04:57,740 --> 02:05:01,030
He... will bring balance.

1462
02:05:02,203 --> 02:05:04,123
Train him.

1463
02:05:31,107 --> 02:05:32,937
Now, Viceroy,

1464
02:05:33,026 --> 02:05:36,486
you're going to have to go back to the senate
and explain all this.

1465
02:05:38,197 --> 02:05:41,487
I think you can kiss
your trade franchise good-bye.

1466
02:05:55,256 --> 02:05:58,796
We are indebted to you for your bravery,
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1467
02:05:58,885 --> 02:06:00,755
And you, young Skywalker.

1468
02:06:00,845 --> 02:06:04,925
We will watch your career with great interest.

1469
02:06:11,356 --> 02:06:13,976
Congratulations on your election, Chancellor.

1470
02:06:14,067 --> 02:06:17,527
Your boldness has saved our people, Your Majesty.

1471
02:06:17,612 --> 02:06:20,032
It's you who should be congratulated.

1472
02:06:20,114 --> 02:06:24,084
Together we shall bring
peace and prosperity to the Republic.

1473
02:06:28,456 --> 02:06:33,536
Confer on you the level of Jedi knight
the council does.

1474
02:06:33,628 --> 02:06:38,378
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1475
02:06:38,466 --> 02:06:40,426
I do not.

1476
02:06:40,510 --> 02:06:42,550
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1477
02:06:45,014 --> 02:06:47,934
The chosen one the boy may be.

1478
02:06:48,017 --> 02:06:49,937
Nevertheless,

1479
02:06:50,019 --> 02:06:52,939
grave danger I fear in his training.

1480
02:06:53,022 --> 02:06:56,612
Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1481
02:06:56,693 --> 02:06:58,613
I will train Anakin.

1482
02:06:58,695 --> 02:07:01,105
Ohh!

1483
02:07:01,197 --> 02:07:04,117
Without the approval of the council, if I must.

1484
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:06,620
Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you.

1485
02:07:06,703 --> 02:07:08,623
Need that you do not.

1486
02:07:10,707 --> 02:07:13,997
Agree with you the council does.

1487
02:07:15,044 --> 02:07:18,384
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1488
02:07:45,450 --> 02:07:47,950
What will happen to me now?

1489
02:07:48,036 --> 02:07:51,156
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1490
02:07:51,247 --> 02:07:54,617
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

1491
02:08:03,426 --> 02:08:06,506
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1492
02:08:06,596 --> 02:08:10,056
Mmm. Always two there are.

1493
02:08:10,141 --> 02:08:13,271
No more, no less.

1494
02:08:13,352 --> 02:08:16,152
A master and an apprentice.

1495
02:08:16,230 --> 02:08:18,150
But which was destroyed?

1496
02:08:18,232 --> 02:08:21,152
The master or the apprentice?

1497
02:08:45,802 --> 02:08:47,892
Hello, everybody!

1498
02:09:34,517 --> 02:09:36,427
Peace!

1499
02:09:36,519 --> 02:09:39,399
- Ya-hoo!
